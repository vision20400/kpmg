Microsoft .NET A wide range of .NET experiences will open the door to significant new benefits for consumers and business users, as well as revenue opportunities for Microsoft. Click here to learn more about these .NET experiences. Microsoft .NET Just as our development of PC operating systems and other software technologies have driven growth in the industry over the past quarter century, today we are working to enable a new era of empowerment for computer users, and growth opportunities for both businesses and software developers. Microsoft .NET comprises the software and services that will power the Next Generation Internet. As anyone who has used a PC knows, today's Internet experience can be fun, exciting and informative. It also can be confusing and difficult. For example, Web browsing, content authoring and editing, e-mail, calendaring and contacts each require separate applications that have widely varying functionality and compatibility. Communicating between devices such as PCs, mobile phones and handheld devices is challenging at best. Meanwhile, information on the Internet continues to exist on ""digital islands"" of independent Web sites. This information is easy to browse, but difficult to edit or manipulate in any useful way. There is enormous benefit and opportunity in linking these isolated islands of data, services and devices in ways that will enable people and businesses to communicate and collaborate more easily. This is where Microsoft .NET comes into play, enabling easier, more personalized and more productive Internet experiences by harnessing constellations of smart devices and Web sites with advanced software based on open Internet standards and protocols, including XML. In addition, Microsoft .NET will offer computer users a unified interface that adapts to whatever they are doing, wherever they are, and is device-independent – a kind of ""universal canvas"" for the Digital Age. Microsoft .NET will create immense opportunity for hundreds of thousands of developers and industry partners, by providing the tools to build a new generation of truly distributed Web services that will transform the Internet and every other aspect of computing. Microsoft .NET will revolutionize computing and communications in the first decade of the 21st century, by being the first platform that takes full advantage of both. Microsoft .NET will take several years to come to full fruition, but we are tremendously excited about the potential. The Foundations of Microsoft .NET Microsoft .NET will build extensively on Microsoft's current core businesses, including the Windows family of desktop and server operating systems, enterprise server applications, Microsoft Office and MSN, each of which is performing strongly today. Windows 2000 has met with strong customer adoption and highly favorable reviews among IT managers, office users and industry analysts, making it the most powerful business operating system ever released by Microsoft. Underscoring its reliability and the value of its new features, General Motors, Royal Dutch/Shell, Xerox Corp., and leading PC manufacturers – such as Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., and Toshiba Corp. – are all deploying Windows 2000. Windows Me, the latest version of the Windows operating system designed specifically for home users, released in September, provides consumers with an improved user and Internet experience, enhanced home-based networking features and compelling new digital media tools. Today, Windows 2000 servers are powering the World Wide Web. A majority of the top Internet retail sites, business-to-business Web sites and secure Web sites are running on Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and more Fortune 500 sites are running on Windows 2000 technology than any other technology. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, launched in September 2000, will provide even more power and reliability for high-traffic networks. If Windows 2000 is the foundation of Microsoft's .NET strategy, our .NET Enterprise Server products are the cornerstones. In the year ahead we are launching seven new and updated enterprise server products. Microsoft's range of server applications, combined with the power and reliability of Windows 2000, offer versatility and affordability unrivaled by any of our competitors. They also represent significant new opportunities to enhance Microsoft's revenue stream. Microsoft Office revenue was strong as major enterprise accounts continued to adopt the world's most popular productivity suite. The growing deployment of Windows 2000 on the desktop is expected to further stimulate sales of Office 2000. New technologies that integrate Web services directly into the Office user experience, as well as tools that enable users to more efficiently store, access and analyze crucial business information, are being developed for future versions of Microsoft Office. Office.NET will offer a powerful productivity and communications service designed to meet the needs of 21st century knowledge workers. Use of Microsoft's Visio® and Microsoft Project applications is also continuing to grow and empower knowledge workers in important new ways. Fiscal year 2000 was a defining year for MSN. In June, the MSN network of Internet services became the #1 worldwide Internet destination for consumers. In the United States, MSN grew significantly faster than Yahoo! or AOL. With MSN services available in 33 international markets and 17 languages, it is the #1 site among consumers in many countries around the world. Our MSN Internet Access business grew by more than 50 percent. Key to this remarkable growth is MSN best-of-breed services, including MSN Hotmail®, the world's largest e-mail system with more than 67 million active accounts; MSN Messenger Service, our instant messaging service with more than 18 million users; MSN Search, the second most popular search service on the Web; and MSN eShop, which experienced a significant increase in holiday traffic last year.

Investments in Tomorrow One of the keys to Microsoft's success over our first 25 years is the long-term view we have taken toward the development of technologies such as Windows, Office, MSN and other products. In the coming year, we will continue to focus on promising new technological advances in a number of key fields. Television Digital and enhanced television products and services represent a significant growth opportunity for Microsoft and one that will give consumers more choice and control over when and what they watch, richer participation with TV programming, and convenient access to the Internet and family and friends. Microsoft is investing in three areas: Working with television service operators – including AT&T in the United States, UPC in Europe, Rogers in Canada, and Towngas/iCare in Hong Kong – to deploy enhanced TV to more than 15 million subscribers via the Microsoft platform; Joining with DIRECTV, Thomson, and Sony to produce UltimateTV, a one-box, one-service enhanced TV solution that will include two digital tuners to enable background recording, and a 40-gigabyte hard drive capable of recording 35 hours of TV programming. Continuing to grow the WebTV® service, which now has more than 1 million subscribers who can participate in new ways with their favorite TV shows, vote in live polls, receive up-to-the-minute news coverage, and send and receive e-mail using their TV set at home. Games In the last few years, Microsoft has emerged as one of the top PC games publishers in the United States. In calendar 1999, Microsoft had two of the top five best sellers: Flight Simulator and Age of Empires®. During the 1999 holiday season, we were the only games publisher with three titles on the Top 10 list. Building on this success, Microsoft is investing significant resources to develop Xbox™, which will compete with the Sony PlayStation and game consoles by Sega and Nintendo in a multi-billion-dollar industry. The hardware design for Xbox is already complete, and Microsoft has 30 game titles for it under development in-house, with more in the works by third-party developers. The fall 2001 launch of Xbox will be Microsoft's biggest ever – larger even than Windows 95. Wireless Microsoft will invest substantially in the coming year to enable truly intelligent communications that fluidly traverse the boundaries of work, individual and family time, while offering ways to control the tremendous volume of available information. Alliances are key to our wireless strategy. For example, we are working with AT&T and British Telecommunications on mobile applications for next-generation data networks; with NTT DoCoMo of Tokyo to develop wireless portals; and with Ericsson to create end-to-end solutions and services for the wireless Internet. One of the biggest opportunities is working with network operators and carriers to empower their service platforms with Microsoft's existing and emerging technologies. The building blocks of .NET will further enhance the types of services we will be able to provide. Microsoft is developing platforms and applications for a variety of mobile handheld devices, including cellular/mobile phones, Pocket PCs and smart phones. These devices will offer both voice and rich data capabilities, including true HTML Web browsing on color displays. Our research in smart cards, location-based services, and speech technologies will also have important applications in the wireless arena. Small Business A great opportunity exists for Microsoft to help small businesses increase productivity and take advantage of the Internet to connect in new ways with customers, industry partners, and suppliers. Today, small businesses represent nearly 60 percent of the global economy. Yet their investments in software are far smaller per desktop than larger enterprises, even as they are being increasingly impacted by the digital economy. The emergence of the Internet and .NET services will make technology more accessible and relevant to small businesses than ever before. By providing complete business solutions that include productivity, customer management and collaboration software, as well as technologies to power the specific needs of small-business operations and e-commerce, Microsoft can enable small businesses to better use technology to their business advantage. Over the next four years, technology spending by small businesses is forecast to increase by more than $50 billion. With more than 1 million registered users, bCentral™, Microsoft's Web-based small-business portal is already #1 in terms of reach. Over the next year, bCentral will deliver a number of new Web services, as well as launch in five additional countries. We will also be launching a new version of the leading small-business server suite, Small Business Server 2000. Building the Future Together In partnership with thousands of other technology companies that share our vision of high-performance, affordable computing, Microsoft has helped build a high-tech industry that is thriving on innovation and competition, and driving growth in the U.S. economy. That is one of the reasons why we believe the appellate courts will rule in Microsoft's favor in the antitrust lawsuit and uphold the well- established legal precedent that U.S. antitrust law should encourage, not discourage, firms to improve their products rapidly to meet customer needs. We also believe the appellate courts will recognize that the district court's order to break up Microsoft and impose crippling regulations reached far beyond the facts of the case, and would lead to less innovation, fewer choices and higher prices. Finally, on the occasion of Microsoft's 25th anniversary, we would like to take a moment to acknowledge the passionate, smart, dedicated employees who have helped make Microsoft the global leader in software, as well as our millions of shareholders, thousands of business partners, and hundreds of millions of customers around the world who have enabled the company to succeed over the years. The future is filled with amazing possibilities and opportunities, and our passion for improving people's lives through great software will allow us to contribute even more than in our first 25 years.and opportunities, and our passion for improving people's lives through great software will allow us to contribute even more than in our first 25 years."
2001,MICROSOFT,"Twenty years ago, the MS-DOS®-based IBM PC had a tiny processor, a minuscule amount of memory, an even smaller amount of storage, and sold for $1,595 – equivalent to more than $3,000 in today’s dollars. Even so, it was a remarkable advance in technology. Today, a PC that is thousands of times more powerful sells for less than $800. But it’s not just the power and the price that have changed so dramatically over the last two decades. What’s most remarkable is how software advances have made the PC an increasingly indispensable and versatile tool in the workplace, at home and at school. Other electronic advances of this century, like the radio, the TV and the fax machine – while breakthroughs to be sure – have but one use. Software makes the PC, by comparison, a multi-talented workhorse. Software powers the operations of the world’s largest businesses. It enables people to shop for cars, books, music or just about anything else from the convenience of their home. Software facilitates instantaneous communication between people living in Sydney and São Paulo. And it helps junior high school students in New York do research for their classes. Even more amazing are the opportunities ahead. As software grows increasingly dynamic, flexible and responsive, the PC is becoming the hub of an expanding universe of software-connected devices that will enable businesses and people to realize their potential. 2001 Fiscal 2001 was a year of solid customer enthusiasm for Microsoft products and services – all the more significant considering the challenging economic climate and turbulence in the technology industry. Revenues increased by $2.34 billion to $25.3 billion, and operating income increased by $710 million to $11.72 billion. The Windows family of products turned in a strong performance, led by brisk sales of Windows 2000 Professional. Microsoft SQL Server™ 2000 and Exchange 2000 Server drove record revenues for Microsoft’s rapidly growing enterprise server business. Our productivity and business-services offerings expanded significantly with the launch of Office XP – the newest version of Microsoft’s business productivity suite – and the acquisition of Great Plains Software, Inc., a leading supplier of mid-market business applications. Microsoft’s consumer software and services business, led by MSN momentum, grew at an impressive 20 percent rate, despite a rugged environment in the online space. 2002 Building on Microsoft .NET – the company’s platform for next-generation software and services – fiscal 2002 promises to be a year of continued growth for Microsoft in five key areas: Expanding on the power and flexibility of the personal computer and taking the PC experience to the next level of opportunity for customers and the IT industry; 15 Meeting the needs of business customers – from the enterprise to medium and small businesses – with a new generation of mission-critical servers and business applications; Taking advantage of key market opportunities in the consumer space with emerging businesses such as MSN, devices and games; Partnering with developers around the globe to create next-generation XML-based software applications, solutions and experiences; Capitalizing on the enormous potential of services delivered over the Internet and across an expanding range of devices. Major product developments in Fiscal 2002 will include the launch of Windows XP – the most significant new desktop operating system product since Windows 95, and Xbox, Microsoft’s future-generation videogame system. We will extend and advance the range and abilities of Microsoft’s Windows .NET Server operating systems and .NET Enterprise Server applications, and deploy new solution offerings that help businesses connect with customers, integrate seamlessly with partners, enable employees and extend into new business opportunities. We will see continued adoption of our flagship Office XP suite for knowledge workers, and expansion of our Great Plains® business applications. The developer community is eagerly anticipating the release of Visual Studio® .NET, Microsoft’s rapid applicationdevelopment tool for building next-generation Web applications and XML Web services. And we will continue to see significant growth in MSN Internet access and network services. Microsoft .NET and XML Web Services In addition to these major new product launches, Microsoft is laying a solid framework for the future with a projected investment of approximately $5 billion in research and development in fiscal 2002. At the center of our R&D efforts is Microsoft .NET, an innovative effort as significant in the development of computing as the graphical user interface and the introduction of the Internet. .NET is Microsoft’s platform for a new computing model built around XML Web Services. Just as the Web revolutionized how users interact with content, XML is revolutionizing how applications communicate with data and how computers and devices communicate – by providing a universal data format that lets information be easily shared, adapted or transformed. .NET will create new opportunities for Microsoft and for thousands of developers and industry partners by enabling constellations of PCs, servers, smart devices and Internet-based services to collaborate seamlessly. Businesses will be able to integrate their processes, share data and join forces to offer customers much more dynamic, personalized and productive experiences – across the PC and an expanding universe of devices – than are available today. In 1995, Microsoft’s primary business and revenue stream was from our desktop products – Windows and Office. In 2002, desktop products will still provide the majority of our revenue, although our server and enterprise business is a rapidly growing contributor to our overall revenues, and MSN, Xbox and other emerging businesses continue to expand our foundation for the future. Over the next five years, as 16 we infuse XML Web Services into all our businesses, we see the opportunities for growth continuing. This transformation is key to expanding our revenue stream moving forward. People As we expect to grow this year to more than 50,000 employees, we will continue to put a high priority on developing our next generation of business leaders, and ensuring that we have the appropriate management initiatives and tools to enable and empower a creative work environment. Our attrition rate – at 8 percent annually – is less than half the average of the overall software and IT-services industry. Meanwhile, we continue to explore new ways to foster a progressive work environment that attracts and inspires bright, passionate people who are committed to continuously improving our products, and to creating a collaborative work environment where individual excellence and teamwork is rewarded. Facilitating a diverse workforce at Microsoft and within our industry continues to be an important priority. The Antitrust Lawsuit Microsoft is committed to continuing to deliver innovations to customers and new opportunities for partners and the technology industry as a whole. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in the antitrust lawsuit significantly narrowed a lower court ruling that threatened to stifle industry innovation. We are continuing to work vigorously to resolve the remaining issues in the case in a manner that will provide clarity to Microsoft and the marketplace while enabling Microsoft to meet the needs of consumers and the industry. Industry Leadership As a successful company, we understand that we have a responsibility to provide leadership in the broader industry. Particularly given the difficult economic times, it’s important that our industry work together to build on the technological advances that have fueled productivity and growth over the last decade. Our work on .NET, XML Web Services and open industry standards are examples of the deep industry engagement to which Microsoft is dedicated. While vigorous competition will always be a healthy hallmark of our industry, we are also committed to building relationships – with partners and even competitors. Two years ago, we outlined a set of values that have evolved since Microsoft’s founding and which capture the spirit of our business practices (microsoft.com/mscorp/values.htm). As we look to the future, the cultural assets that have been such an important part of Microsoft’s success over the past 25 years will continue to evolve. One of the most fundamental of these cultural attributes is our commitment to accountability. Accountability to customers by continuing to improve product satisfaction. Accountability to partners, including smaller businesses and start-ups, who share the vision of affordable, connected computing. Accountability to the technical community through support of resources that enable software developers to create the next generation of products and grow successful businesses. Accountability to shareholders by continuing to invest in growth opportunities for the future, while staying focused on managing our business today. The Digital Decade 17 Over the past 20 years the personal computer has transformed the way people work, communicate, learn and play. It has stimulated productivity and collaboration in the workplace, connected people around the world, and become a powerful and affordable tool for learning and entertainment. Yet even greater technological advances are just ahead. XML Web Services will open up new possibilities in e-commerce, business planning, and customer service. Document and workflow management will become simpler and more comprehensive. Technologies such as the advanced speech and handwritingrecognition capabilities of the next-generation Tablet PC will transform the workplace for knowledge workers. Inexpensive, high-capacity disk drives, powerful audio and video capabilities and easy-to-use digital cameras will make the PC an entertainment and information hub for the home. More than 500 million PCs are already in use around the world, and another 130 million or more will be purchased in calendar 2001 – more than the number of TVs that will likely be purchased this year. Increasingly, the PC is moving to the center of an ever-expanding network of smart, connected devices – from mobile phones to televisions and handheld devices, even household appliances. There has never been a more exciting time in the history of our industry. The coming digital decade will be a time of enormous opportunity: for consumers, for the technology industry, and for Microsoft as we realize the vision of empowering people through great software – any time, any place and on any device. "
2002,MICROSOFT,"Fiscal 2002 was a year of solid revenue growth, significant product releases, and a continued focus on developing new technologies that position Microsoft for the future. Despite a challenging economic climate, revenues for the year increased by $3.07 billion to $28.37 billion, and operating income grew by $190 million to $11.91 billion. Strong demand for Windows XP and other desktop software contributed to our positive performance. Revenue from enterprise software outpaced the highly competitive server market by a wide margin. And our consumer businesses saw a dramatic rise in sales, with the launch of the Xbox video game system and strong growth in MSN subscription income. During the coming year, Microsoft will launch several important new products, including Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows .NET Servers, and we plan to increase spending on research and development by 20 percent, to $5.2 billion. To reflect our role as an industry leader and to focus our efforts on the opportunities ahead, we have embraced a new corporate mission: to enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential. Delivering on this mission requires a clearly defined set of values and tenets. We are working to integrate these principles into everything we do. INNOVATIVE PLATFORM LEADERSHIP A highlight of the past year was the overwhelming market acceptance that greeted the launch of Windows XP, which brings enhanced reliability, security, and performance to PC users at home and work. The year also saw sustained momentum for Office XP, with more than 60 million licenses sold in the 12 months after its launch in May 2001. A new version of Office, scheduled for release in 2003, will enable users to communicate and collaborate in new ways with even greater ease. Delivering on our vision of software that empowers people any time, any place, and on any device, we launched new versions of Windows for small and mobile devices, including Pocket PCs and set-top boxes for digital cable TV. Fall 2002 brings the launch of the first Tablet PCs, designed to boost productivity by combining the power and speed of a full-featured desktop computer with the flexibility and portability of a notepad. One of our key goals is to expand our role as a provider of software solutions for small- and mid-sized businesses. In July 2002, we acquired Navision, a leading global provider of integrated software for financial management and other business processes. Combining Navision with Microsoft Great Plains to form Microsoft Business Solutions, we now offer a wide range of applications and services that enable companies to reduce costs, streamline operations, and improve service. We are planning many new products for this market, including a solution for customer relationship management that will launch this fiscal year. THE PROMISE OF .NET AND XML WEB SERVICES A significant portion of the company’s revenue growth over the next five years will come from Microsoft’s .NET architecture, which holds enormous potential to connect information, people, systems, and devices in fundamentally new and important ways. Using common industry standards based on XML, a universal language for describing and exchanging data, our goal is to enable seamless sharing of information across many platforms and programming languages, and over the Internet, with XML Web Services. The potential of Web services is gaining wide support among software developers and leading technology providers. For example, the Web Services Interoperability Organization, formed by Microsoft and other industry leaders in early 2002 to provide guidance and best practices for developing XML Web services, now has more than 120 companies as members. To provide software developers with the tools and infrastructure for building and deploying XML Web services and other .NET-connected solutions, we launched Visual Studio .NET and the .NET Framework in February 2002. In fiscal 2003 we plan to launch Windows .NET Servers, which will provide the most compelling platform for developing and hosting Web services and business solutions. Companies that are helping to test the promising beta version of Windows .NET Servers foresee many benefits. JetBlue Airways, for example, plans to use it as the platform for a new reservations system and to secure access to its computers and facilities with fingerprint biometrics embedded in smart cards. The young airline has achieved a “paperless cockpit” by providing pilots with electronic versions of flight manuals that are automatically updated with an application that JetBlue developers wrote using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. JetBlue credits Microsoft technology with helping it to limit spending on information technology to about 1.5 percent of revenues, in an industry where the average is about 5 percent. DELIGHTING CONSUMERS Our strategic investments in new consumer businesses brought gratifying results this past year, with more to come in 2003. In the eight months after our Xbox video game system launched in November 2001, 3.9 million consoles and 20 million Xbox games were sold. MSN, already the most popular portal destination on the Web, is now also the leading provider of broadband Internet access. Microsoft and more than a dozen leading electronics manufacturers have developed a new line of flat-panel, cordless displays that enable consumers to extend their Windows XP experience to anywhere in the house. These Smart Displays will start appearing in stores in time for the 2002 holiday shopping season, as will PCs running our new Windows XP Media Center Edition, providing remote-control access to digital music, movies, and a built-in personal video recorder. INVESTING IN THE FUTURE We are focused on long-term success for Microsoft as a business, for our 50,000 employees, our shareholders, our industry, our customers, and the communities where we do business. Looking to the future, a few developments are noteworthy. Antitrust Lawsuit In November 2001, Microsoft and the Department of Justice announced a settlement of the three-year-old antitrust dispute. Nine state attorneys general joined in the settlement, while nine others decided to continue with the case. The settlement requires significant changes in how we do business, and Microsoft is fully committed to carrying out these responsibilities. The consent decree is a tough but reasonable compromise that is good for the industry, good for consumers, and good for the economy. Trustworthy Computing In January 2002, we outlined for employees what we believe is the highest priority for the company and for our industry over the next decade: building a computing environment for customers that is as reliable as the electricity that lights our homes. As a first step in achieving higher levels of reliability, security, privacy, and business integrity, Microsoft made many changes in our operational and business practices. Thousands of our engineers received special training in writing secure software. And we conducted intensive security analyses of every line of source code for Windows and other products. These efforts are starting to show results. Security updates of Microsoft Outlook, for instance, were followed by a dramatic drop in the number of e-mail virus incidents. But given the complexity of computing and the fast pace of technological change, achieving truly Trustworthy Computing will take many years. An Agile Business System To streamline internal decision making, enhance entrepreneurship within Microsoft’s key businesses, and increase collaboration across groups, we instituted a number of changes to internal business systems. One of the most significant changes was giving the leaders of our key businesses the tools, resources, and responsibility for making the important decisions around product development, sales, marketing, and financial performance. Business Integrity During the past year, a number of major corporations were rocked by financial scandals that damaged shareholder wealth and confidence. At Microsoft, we take our responsibilities to shareholders, customers, partners, and employees very seriously. We aim to be open and candid about the condition of our business and the risks we face. We seek to properly assess assets so they are never overvalued, and we look hard for any costs or liabilities that should be reflected in our financial results. Consistent with the values of honesty and integrity that we strive to live by, we have long disclosed complete details of the diluting effect of employee stock options on Microsoft’s earnings. Stock options are an important way that Microsoft attracts and encourages great employees. For the two of us, the vast majority of our individual net worth is invested in stock ownership of the business. Since Microsoft went public in 1986, we have never taken stock options, and we never will. We hope this provides further assurance that our personal interests are directly aligned with the long-term interests of all shareholders. Finally, on a personal level, we feel incredibly privileged to play a role in bringing to life the technologies that will enable people and businesses to realize their full potential. Thank you for your support."
2003,MICROSOFT,"Fiscal 2003 was a year of important and exciting innovations, reflected in many new Microsoft products that advance our mission of enabling people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential. Despite challenging economic conditions, revenue increased by $3.82 billion to $32.19 billion, and operating income grew by $1.31 billion to $13.22 billionRevenue in each of Microsoft's seven business segments grew by 11 percent or more. During the year, the company's senior leadership refined our strategy for achieving continued growth and success in the years aheadTo help you understand our approach to the possibilities before us, we would like to outline our business plan. TopA challenging environment Because Microsoft is making substantial investments today to enhance the power and value of an integrated computing platform, we are optimistic about the company's long-term growth opportunitiesLike any business, however, we face challenges in the near- and mid-termWe are addressing them head-on. One of the most important challenges lies in serving business customersHaving recently invested in Y2K upgrades and the Internet, businesses want their future technology investments to do more and cost lessMany enterprises are migrating their server networks from proprietary hardware running the UNIX operating system to less expensive alternatives built on Intel microprocessorsMicrosoft can benefit from this shift because we provide customers with comprehensive, end-to-end technology solutions and unmatched valueLast year, our server and tools revenue increased 16 percent. Some organizations migrating from UNIX are considering noncommercial software such as Linux and OpenOfficeWhile the initial cost of acquiring a stripped-down, do-it-yourself operating system may seem attractive, a growing body of independent research shows that our integrated platform provides not only greater functionality but also lower total cost of ownership in most common business functions. Today the Windows platform offers unmatched simplicity, security, choice of applications, and overall business valueTomorrow the Windows advantage over the competition will continue to widen as we continue to invest in innovation. Still, Linux and other noncommercial software present a challenge, and we are not complacentWe are working hard to ensure that our products and services continue to improve and meet customer demands for valueWe are committed to exceed our customers' expectations for product reliability, security, and engineering excellence. In order to take computing to the next level for customers, our business plan identifies six things we will do: Provide breakthrough, high-quality integrated innovation; Deliver best-in-class responsiveness to customers; Make our platform the best for developers; Deliver simple, high-value experiences and services; Ignite customer enthusiasm and tell the Microsoft story; and Build our talent pool and increase productivity. TopIntegrated innovation We believe that customers will find enormous value in a truly integrated, affordable software platform that takes the complexity out of computingWe are positioning Microsoft to deliver on the promise of this visionIn FY04, the company plans to invest $6.8 billion in R&D innovation. To continue to strengthen our value proposition, we are focused on the following objectives: Continue to advance the development of an end-to-end technology platform that seamlessly integrates hardware and software from the enterprise to the desktop to wireless mobile devices; Address security, manageability, and reliability; Provide high-value and easy-to-use technologies that support customer scenarios ""right out of the box""—with little or no customization; Continue to support and grow a worldwide ecosystem of complementary hardware, software, and services partners; Achieve strong integration between our products and services, and applications on other systems, through standards of interoperability and XML Web services; and Ensure that we protect and derive value from the intellectual property we create. A great example of the kind of value we see in integrated innovation is Windows XP Tablet PC EditionReleased last fall, it combines all the power of Windows XP with true mobility and advanced ink and speech tools for a more dynamic and flexible computing experienceToday, there are 40 computer makers that offer versions of the Tablet PC, and independent software vendors have created exciting applications for it. Another great example is Windows Server 2003, the flagship of our integrated platform for business, which helps organizations be more agile, productive, and secureIt incorporates important new security and reliability features, and advances in management, applications platform and information worker support, not to mention a #1 ranking in scalability. Exchange Server 2003, released June 30, offers new levels of integration in server and client capabilities, enabling organizations to easily create and manage business communications both in the office and on the roadMicrosoft Office 2003, to be released this fall along with new applications in the Office System, will fundamentally change how people communicate, collaborate, and manage their information. As we look to the future, Longhorn, the next generation of Windows, is our big investment in driving a new wave in computing, including a new applications platform, new end-user functionality and services, and major advances in deployment, upgrading, management, reliability, security, and performance. We are excited about opportunities to innovate for customers with a consistent approach in other areas—in new products, services, and solutions, and in innovations to Windows and OfficeAn example is our new Microsoft Business Solutions CRM, which provides mid-sized businesses with powerful tools to build profitable customer relationships, improve sales, and deliver efficient service. We see opportunities to transform how people use technology at home and on the move, with software for telephones, all the electronic devices in the living room, and personal wear, as well as games and educational software for consumersLast year we launched many important new consumer products, including Windows Powered Smart Displays, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows Powered Smartphones, MSN 8, and Xbox Live. TopResponsiveness to customers Providing value to customers means not only building great products, but also listening carefully to customers, responding quickly, and being more transparent and accountable. We responded to business customers' concerns about our licensing programs with a new Software Assurance program, recently enhanced, that provides more assistance, more support and training options, more predictability, and more value than ever before. We listened to customers' concerns about product quality, and responded with a companywide drive for Trustworthy Computing, aimed at constant improvement in reliability, security, privacy, and business integrityWe have made significant progress, and this important work will continue long into the future. We have intensified our focus on engineering excellence to help ensure that our products are not only more trustworthy but also more compatible, scalable, and manageableWe continue to enhance the capabilities of our products to automatically detect problems, perform diagnostics, apply known solutions, and prevent future problemsWe have made progress in improving our product support operations, and we will help customers solve problems with more consistent documentation and richer Web services. In short, we are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that our customers are highly satisfied with our products and servicesUnderscoring our commitment, we recently revised the incentive system for hundreds of our senior leaders so a significant part of their equity compensation depends on progress in the number and satisfaction of our customers. TopSupporting developers The popularity of Windows derives in large part from its support for the broadest array of applicationsMicrosoft has a long history of providing programmers with state-of-the-art tools and services that make it easy and rewarding to develop for our platform. Our new Visual Studio .NET 2003 is the most advanced and complete set of software development tools, enabling developers to greatly improve their productivity with a single programming model for PC, mobile, and Web applicationsIt is the definitive tool set for building Web services with the .NET Framework. We also are expanding efforts to build deeper relationships with developersFor example, we are pairing our developers with industry peers to help us better understand their needs and help them with their issuesAnd we are making Windows development more accessible to a wide range of programmers, including students, novices, hobbyists, and other nonprofessionals. We are creating new opportunities for developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) by expanding the platform for their applications beyond WindowsWe will help ISVs develop add-ons and applications for Office and other products, such as those from Microsoft Business Solutions. We are proactively communicating with ISVs about our own application development plans so that they can choose their best opportunities, and we are extending our co-marketing and selling with ISVsHelping ISVs find customers and vice versa can be a real advantage for us, our partners, and our customers. TopSimplicity, value, understanding One of our primary objectives in innovating the integrated platform is to provide simpler, more compelling, complete, and targeted customer experiencesWe are adding more capabilities to existing products, and segmenting our product offerings to deliver the simplest, most valuable package of our technologies, at the right price, for specific customer sets such as small businesses, students, home users, and information workers at home. The right mix of our technologies, offered as services in the right set of segmented offers, will dramatically enhance the value delivered to customers. Many customers and partners have said they would appreciate our innovations more if they knew Microsoft and its people betterWe are encouraging our developers to participate more in the communities around their products, and we are communicating more broadly about our work in important areas such as security, privacy, and rights management. Executives, too, are spending even more time listening to customers— not just to technology managers, but to IT users, developers, and even schoolkids. We also have increased our advertising budget, communicating in ways that illuminate the amazing work we and our partners do, and explaining our mission to help people realize their potential. TopExcellence in people and processes As a company whose primary assets are intellectual property, we are constantly focused on attracting and retaining the people who create it, the top talent in our industryWe had great success last year as we expanded our recruitment and career-development efforts in core areas such as product development, marketing, finance, sales, and operations. Because Microsoft's success depends entirely on the great ideas of our employees, we are committed to continuing to provide a diverse workplace where people feel at home, have an opportunity to develop their skills, and find new and interesting opportunities. In July, we took steps to enhance employee compensationWe are no longer issuing employee stock options, but instead granting stock awards that vest over several yearsThis will offer employees more stable equity compensation, and will better align employee and shareholder interests. While we continue to invest for the future, we also continue to search for ways to reduce overhead and become more efficientWe recently named chief financial officers for each of our seven business segments to help further improve our financial management. TopThe path forward We believe our business plan puts us on a sure path to achieve our goalsAll our actions are aimed at putting the customer firstDoing so, we believe, is critical to our continued success. Making technology easier and better for customers was our inspiration 20 years ago, when Microsoft announced its graphical user interface for personal computersWe called it Windows, and it helped revolutionize computingToday, we are developing a range of integrated products that will again transform how people work, learn, communicate, and are entertainedWe are totally focused on our mission of enabling people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potentialWe deeply appreciate your support for our efforts."
2004,MICROSOFT,"For Microsoft, fiscal 2004 was a great year, marked by strong growth and development of exciting new technologies. All of our businesses grew during the year, increasing total revenue by $4.65 billion, or 14 percent, to $36.8 billion. Profit margins from continuing operations improved, particularly in our emerging businesses. In the past year we delivered amazing new products and services, including Office System 2003, new versions of Windowsâ XP for Media Center and for Tablet PCs, Exchange Server 2003, Windows Small Business Server 2003, BizTalkâ Server 2004, Speech Server 2004, MSN Messenger 6.2, Windows CE 5.0, and several new business solutions for small and mid-market customers. We made progress against some of the biggest problems facing customers today, such as the costly epidemic of junk e-mail, and security threats from attacks over the Internet. Our progress on security is reflected in the important advances in Windows XP Service Pack 2, which enables safer Web browsing, e-mailing, and instant messaging. We also made major progress in reducing our legal risks and strengthening relationships within our industry and with governments. Building on this progress, we are confident that Microsoft will continue to grow and create long-term value for shareholders. Accordingly, the board of directors has approved a plan to return cash to investors on an unprecedented scale. During the next four years, the company is on track to return as much as $75 billion to shareholders, by increasing the regular dividend, expanding our stock buyback program, and declaring a special dividend of $3 per share, subject to shareholder approval as described in the proxy statement. We will continue to have ample resources to pursue the enormous growth opportunities that we see ahead. All of us at Microsoft are intensely focused on realizing these opportunities by continuing to deliver integrated, cutting-edge technology, and through operational excellence. Integrated Innovation Microsoft was built on innovation, and our future depends on it. We are in an extraordinary position to deliver even greater value to customers through a broad set of technologies, designed to complement each other and many third-party products and services. This is what we mean by integrated innovation, which is key to our business strategy. To drive innovation, Microsoft has a long-term commitment to research and development. Our investment to date has brought about many of the successful products we offer today, and has built an increasingly valuable store of intellectual property. In fiscal 2004, we applied for more than 2,000 patents on some of our recent innovations. During the coming year, we plan to file for another 3,000 patents, which will make us one of the largest patent filers in the world. Our innovations are available for broad use in others’ products through our patent licensing programs. Security.    A key focus of our innovation is security. Beyond the advances in Windows XP SP2, we are developing advanced technologies that will help isolate computers from Internet attacks and make them more resilient when they are attacked. We are making it easier for customers to keep their systems updated with our latest, most secure software. We are also developing more secure techniques for authenticating network users and controlling their access. And we have implemented new software-development processes, tools, and training to promote engineering excellence and help ensure that new software is more secure by design. In addition, we are collaborating with other industry leaders to develop more effective community responses to security threats, and working closely with governments around the world to bring cyber-criminals to justice. Through this broad, multi-pronged approach, our goal is to help bring significant improvements in security, and help preserve the benefits of technology for everyone. Our innovation is also focused on exciting market opportunities across our businesses, which we believe hold great potential for growth over the next several years. PC Market Growth.    Today there are 600 million personal computers around the world; by 2010, we estimate the number will grow to one billion. Much of this growth will come from new generations of PCs with enhanced capabilities, such as the Media Center and Tablet PCs that Microsoft has pioneered. We are hard at work on Longhorn—the next generation of Windows—which will lead to exciting new innovations in software, hardware, and services, delivering experiences that should broaden PC adoption and accelerate upgrades. Server Migration.    Businesses are increasingly migrating their computer networks from UNIX servers to less expensive ones running on PC microprocessors. This trend has helped boost sales of Windows server products; revenue from our server and tools business increased 19 percent last year. During the past year, we have worked hard to communicate with customers about the unique value of the Windows platform compared with Linux and other open-source software. Several independent analysts have reported that Windows offers lower total cost of ownership, stronger security, and more comprehensive indemnification. We are continuing to innovate in servers and tools, particularly in areas such as manageability and security. This fiscal year, SQL Serverä 2005 will deliver a significantly improved database platform—more reliable, secure, scalable, and manageable. And Visual Studioâ 2005 aims to reduce complexity and cost for developers and other technology professionals. Connected Productivity.    Our Information Worker business continues to grow, with a 17 percent increase in revenue during 2004. We believe that Word, Excel, Outlookâ, and other Office 2003 applications only begin to fulfill the potential of software to help people be more productive. We have expanded the toolset with new technologies and services such as Office SharePoint Portal Server 2003, Windows SharePointâ Services, Office Live Meeting, Office Online, Office OneNote 2003, and Office InfoPathä 2003. We are also providing our partners with new tools, through the Office Solution Accelerator program, that enable them and us to jointly bring new productivity solutions to customers. There is an enormous market for further improvements in individual, group and organizational productivity through advances in collaboration, communication, business intelligence, planning, and analysis. Business Solutions.    We are strongly positioned to provide software solutions tailored for the vast number of underserved small and mid-sized businesses. Our integrated applications enable these companies to accelerate growth and increase profits by more effectively managing their finances, supply chains, customer relationships, and other key business processes. Several years down the road, we envision powerful new capabilities from the development of a common platform for a new generation of business solutions highly integrated with Longhorn. Online Search, Services, and Advertising.    Our MSN business achieved its first full year of segment profitability in 2004, as advertising revenue increased 43 percent, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. This growth was driven by our MSN.com network’s success in attracting visitors by offering rich information and communication services—including news, sports, entertainment, search, MSN Messenger, and MSN Hotmailâ. We are investing in many new MSN services, including breakthrough search, communication, and music technologies that we believe will deliver superior customer benefits and provide us with significant revenue opportunities. Smart Mobile Devices.    The market for devices that combine a wireless phone with a handheld PC is expected to grow significantly over the next several years. We are vigorously pursuing this opportunity with strategic investments, to ensure that our mobile offerings provide the greatest benefit to consumers and device manufacturers. Our Windows Mobile software is the basis for new Portable Media Center devices from leading consumer electronics companies. Entertainment.    In the huge videogame industry, Xbox continues to show strong momentum, with 15.5 million consoles shipped since launch and more than 425 games published for it. Xbox now ranks second in units sold in the North American and European markets, and is gaining on the market leader. Xbox Liveä, our interactive service with more than one million subscribers in 24 countries, has revolutionized the online gaming business. Looking ahead, we see myriad opportunities to create other entertaining digital experiences via platforms such as Xbox, Windows XP Media Center, and Microsoft TV, a product family that supports a range of digital video services including interactive programming guides, digital video recording, high-definition TV, and on-demand programming. Operational Excellence and Citizenship As we innovate in technology, we are equally focused on crisp execution. In particular, we are working to deliver an unparalleled customer and partner experience. Across the company, we have created new listening, feedback, and response systems to help us get closer to customers and respond quickly and appropriately. Using automated error-reporting technologies, we have fixed a large majority of the computer crashes and hangs reported by customers, and our strengthened field response system has favorably resolved most non-technical issues reported by customers. Microsoft competes vigorously, and we always will. At the same time, we are committed to maintaining positive relationships within our industry, including with competitors, and to forging strong relationships with governments. We are also committed to helping make technology safer and easier to use. We work to help protect the safety of children online, for example, through our partnership with the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. We are deeply engaged in industry efforts to protect peoples’ privacy online, counter the problem of identify theft, and curb the spam epidemic. The fight against spam is a good example of our commitment to the development of industry standards, which accelerate the advance of technology by helping ensure that different devices and software work well together. Microsoft has collaborated on the Sender ID framework, a technology designed to prevent e-mail forgery, which is used to spread spam and perpetrate online fraud. Submitted for consideration as an Internet standard, the Sender ID framework will be freely available for widespread use. Everywhere we do business, we aim to help strengthen local economies. One way is through our products, which help our customers be more productive and competitive. Another way is through our business model, which is based on partnering with more than 600,000 other technology firms throughout the world. They create applications, provide computer services, and, in many other ways, build their businesses on our platform, generating local jobs and billions of dollars in tax revenue. A global study of 22,000 technology companies found that Microsoft’s partners earn an average of $8 for every $1 that Microsoft earns. We are partnering to bring the benefits of technology to communities and classrooms around the world. Last year alone, Microsoft provided more than $440 million in cash and software to more than 5,000 schools and nonprofit organizations. Through our Unlimited Potential and Partners in Learning initiatives, we are working with governments and communities in many countries to promote workforce development and lifelong digital literacy. We are enormously excited by the tremendous possibilities that lie ahead. As ever, we thank you for your continued support."
2005,MICROSOFT,"Fiscal 2005 was another successful year for Microsoft. Customers around the world continue to benefit from our innovations, while our development of new technologies will position the company for future growth. With healthy demand across all our customer segments and channels, 2005 revenue increased by nearly $3 billion to a record $39.79 billion. Operating income increased by 61 percent. During the past five years, Microsoft’s revenue increased 73 percent. We generated more than $162 billion in revenue over the past five years, and about $75 billion in net cash flow from operations. We returned $69 billion of this cash to shareholders in dividends and stock repurchases. Meanwhile, we increased our annual investment in research and development by 23 percent since 2001. Our sixth research facility opened last year in Bangalore, India. We also continued to invest in strategic acquisitions. In 2005, they included Sybari Software, a leading provider of enterprise security solutions, and Groove Networks, a leading provider of collaboration software. And we continued allocating resources to reduce our legal risks. Last year we resolved many legal issues and settled class-action lawsuits in several states. Our future prospects are strong. Before the end of calendar year 2005, several important new products will emerge from our pipeline. We will introduce a new generation of servers and tools with Microsoft® SQL Server™ 2005, Visual Studio® 2005, and BizTalk® Server 2006. We will release Office Small Business Accounting 2006 and Microsoft CRM 3.0, a complete suite of powerful marketing, sales, and service capabilities. We also will launch Xbox 360™, a next-generation video game platform optimized for high-definition entertainment and online play. Next year, we will gather even more momentum with Windows® Vista, our next-generation operating system, and a major upgrade of Office, among many other new products and services. Empowering People for Success Driven by passion for empowering people to achieve business success and realize their potential, each of our seven major business groups grew in 2005. Growth in Server and Tools was particularly strong, helped by rapid customer adoption of SQL Server. We released several important updates to our server products, including Microsoft Operations Manager 2005, Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2004, Virtual Server 2005, and Windows Server™ 2003 Service Pack 1. Mobile and Embedded revenue increased 36 percent as we launched Windows Mobile™ 5.0, our software for mobile devices. We now partner with more than 40 mobile device makers and 68 mobile operators. MSN® achieved its second consecutive year of profitability, launching many new information and communications services as part of its innovative platform for online advertising, which we see as a large market opportunity. Among other innovations, MSN released a powerful new Web search engine and the MSN Search Toolbar with Windows Desktop Search. We launched MSN Music, which provides an easy way for consumers to find and download music online, and we launched MSN Spaces, a blog hosting service that attracted more than 18 million spaces within its first six months. In our Home and Entertainment business, cumulative shipments of the Xbox® video game system reached 22 million, and the Xbox Live® online game service doubled its subscriber base to 2 million. The popular Halo® 2 game, released in November 2004, generated $125 million in North American sales in one day, making its launch one of the largest in entertainment history. Top Many other important products were launched by our Client, Information Worker, and Microsoft Business Solutions businesses: 64-bit editions of Windows XP Professional and Windows Server 2003; new versions of Windows XP for Media Centers and Tablet PCs; Office Live Communications Server 2005 and Office Communicator 2005; Office Live Meeting 2005; Office Outlook® Live; and the Microsoft Business Solutions-Navision® 4.0 software suite for small and mid-sized businesses. Among business customers, our work to deliver greater business value through our software has brought wider recognition of the advantages of Microsoft technologies. In the past year, research reports from more than a dozen independent analyst firms concluded that the Windows Server System is superior to Linux in many important ways. Multiple studies found that Windows has lower total cost of ownership, is more secure and reliable, and includes the industry’s most comprehensive customer indemnification protection. As a result, many enterprises are choosing Windows over other alternatives, or returning to Windows after trying Linux. Growing Microsoft Through Innovation In the years ahead, we believe that Microsoft will continue to succeed through innovation that enhances customers’ digital experiences at work, at home and on the go. We believe we are innovating across a broader spectrum of software technologies than any other company. We develop software for platforms and tools; communication and collaboration; information access and organization; entertainment; business and e-commerce; and devices. Through the synergies of these broad innovations, we are intent on accelerating Microsoft’s growth in three principal ways. Growing our foundation businesses.    In our largest businesses today—the Windows Client, Information Worker, and Server and Tools groups—growth will be driven by hardware shipments and product upgrade cycles, accelerated by our forthcoming innovations such as Windows Vista and the new version of Office. Given the new technologies we will be delivering, we anticipate growth through increased share of growing segments. In servers, for example, we have opportunities to increase our share in Web servers, datacenters, mail servers, and high-performance computing. In addition, we see opportunities to grow these businesses through reducing revenue lost to software piracy. We recently launched Windows Genuine Advantage, an initiative to enhance the benefits from licensing Microsoft software. We believe that rampant piracy in emerging economies will diminish over time as these economies become more integrated into the global economy. Expanding our innovation portfolio.    We see opportunities to grow by developing best-of-class products and services that expand our technology offerings. Within our larger businesses, we are working to develop new technologies that offer greater value in meeting targeted customer needs. These technologies will be offered as new products and as higher-value and segmented versions of existing products, such as Windows Small Business Edition, Windows XP Professional Edition, and Windows XP Media Center Edition. Within our emerging businesses, we are also moving forward with a broad portfolio of technologies, with a goal of providing best-in-class products wherever we compete, such as gaming, software for mobile devices, small business applications, and Internet Protocol television. Delivering software services.    While the PC and Windows remain at the center of consumer and business technology, Internet-based services are growing at dramatic rates. We are working across the company to infuse services into everything we do, and we expect both consumer and business services to be an important part of our future growth. In the past several years, we have gained extensive experience in providing a range of online consumer services, many supported by advertising or subscriptions. Such services include Hotmail, the world’s largest free email service with over 205 million active accounts, MSN.com, one of the world’s most popular online portals, MSN Messenger, MSN Search, and Xbox Live, the world’s largest unified online console gaming service. We are working to deliver several new services, including Windows OneCare Live, an integrated PC Health offering that combines security features as well as critical PC maintenance services. We also have expanded our range of services for businesses, such as Outlook Live and Office Live Meeting, which enables workers to collaborate interactively without the cost and hassle of business travel. Our acquisition of FrontBridge Technologies will enable us to provide managed services that enhance e-mail filtering and improve security for businesses. We see many other opportunities in managed services for businesses. Protecting Customers, Helping Communities As we drive for growth, we are also working to help protect the privacy and security of computer users everywhere through technological innovation, collaboration with industry and government, and education. With our own R&D and strategic acquisitions, we are making our products more secure and delivering comprehensive security solutions. In less than a year, customers have downloaded more than 218 million copies of Windows XP SP2, which helps protect against software worms and viruses. We are aggressively committed to building out our security technologies to fortify all of our products and services. We are also deeply involved in working on behalf of the communities where we do business around the world. We focus on partnering to help extend the benefits of technology to more people and communities. Last year alone, Microsoft provided more than $334 million in cash and software to more than 9,000 nonprofit organizations. Through our Partners in Learning program, we have helped bring technology access and skills to 6.6 million students and educators in 99 countries. We are more enthusiastic than ever about Microsoft’s opportunities to change the world for the better. We can pursue these opportunities because of your continued support. Thank you."
2006,MICROSOFT,"Fiscal 2006 was a year of significant achievement and transformation for Microsoft. During 2006, we celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of our founding, reached new records for revenue and operating income, and laid the foundation for future growth through key changes in our organizational structure and leadership. Fueled by strong demand for new and existing products, our revenue in 2006 grew by $4.49 billion, an 11 percent increase, to $44.28 billion. Operating income reached a record $16.47 billion. We also returned $23 billion to shareholders through dividends and by repurchasing our stock. The past year saw the successful launch of major products including Xbox 360™, Microsoft® SQL Server™ 2005, Visual Studio® 2005, Microsoft Dynamics™ CRM 3.0, and BizTalk® Server 2006. Meanwhile, we continued to prepare for the most important series of product releases in Microsoft history as we readied Windows Vista™, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, and Exchange Server 2007 for launch in 2007. We also strengthened our commitment to Internet services as we unveiled Windows Live™ and Office Live, our two Internet-based software services offerings. Throughout the year, we rolled out new Windows Live and Office Live services and we continue to invest in the development of new technologies and products that will help ensure that we are a leader in the Internet services revolution. During 2006, we maintained our focus on research and development, investing $6.6 billion—more than any other company in our industry. Past investment in R&D paid off in the form of new products and technologies that are helping us redefine the next generation of information technology. Along the way, we received our 5,000th patent. In 2006, we also made a number of strategic acquisitions, including FrontBridge Technologies, a provider of security-enhanced managed messaging services; Teleo, which develops voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) software; mobile search technology provider MotionBridge; and Massive, a pioneer in delivering advertising within video games. Through our commitment to research and development, and our passion for pursuing innovations that enable our customers to achieve business success and realize their potential, we are in a great position to strengthen growth and increase innovation as we pursue new and expanding opportunities in business solutions, mobile computing, communication, entertainment and more. Leadership and Organizational Excellence Great leadership and a strong, agile organization are essential to Microsoft’s future success. During 2006, we took important steps to ensure that the company has the deep roster of leaders and the organizational structure it needs to spur continual innovation and growth. In 2006, we realigned the company into three divisions: the Microsoft Platforms & Services Division led by co-presidents Kevin Johnson and Jim Allchin (who will retire following the launch of Windows Vista); the Microsoft Business Division led by Jeff Raikes as president; and Microsoft Entertainment & Devices Division, where Robbie Bach serves as president. Kevin Turner joined the company as chief operating officer. All of these leaders possess great levels of business experience and technology expertise, combined with a passion for excellence and innovation. Also during 2006, Bill Gates announced that in 2008 he will reduce his workload at Microsoft to part time. At that time, he will remain as chairman of the company and continue to play a vital role as an advisor on key development projects. To prepare for this transition, two of our top technical leaders—and two of the industry’s leading technical visionaries—will take on new responsibilities. Ray Ozzie assumed Bill’s title of chief software architect and is working with Bill on technical architecture and product oversight. Craig Mundie, named chief research and strategy officer, is working with Bill on the company’s research and product incubation efforts. Thanks to these changes, our leadership team is stronger than it has ever been, and our organizational structure is aligned for great execution in the coming years. Enabling People-Ready Businesses At our core, we are a software company. But our defining mission is to help people and businesses realize their full potential. We believe that the right software helps companies become people-ready businesses where employees are empowered and inspired to use technology to solve problems, collaborate with colleagues, serve customers, and seize new opportunities. From the infrastructure innovations in SQL Server 2005 to the enhanced business process integration of new Microsoft Dynamics solutions, many of our product releases in 2006 were designed to provide people with tools and resources they need to drive business success. Product releases in the coming year will strengthen our ability to deliver on our people-ready vision. Windows Vista, the 2007 Office system, and Exchange 2007 will provide powerful new capabilities that enable people to create new levels of business value, fueling further growth for Microsoft. Top A Focus on Long-Term Success Throughout our 30-year history, Microsoft has achieved success by taking a long-term approach to technology. This has enabled us to deliver ground-breaking products that have truly changed the world. The success of this approach was seen across our businesses in 2006 as we brought many new products to market and added new customers in many segments. In the Platforms & Services Division, the launch of new versions of SQL Server and Visual Studio propelled the Server and Tools business to a 15 percent increase in revenue. The Client group saw revenue grow by 9 percent. In the Business Division, the launch of Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, Dynamics CRM 3.0, Dynamics SL 6.5, and Dynamics AX 4.0 helped drive the Business Solutions group past $900 million in revenue. Meanwhile, our Information Worker business grew 5 percent to $11.76 billion. The Entertainment and Devices Division saw strong growth as well. With 5 million units sold to date, Xbox 360 is the fastest-selling video game console ever. It helped drive revenue in the Home and Entertainment business to $4.26 billion, from $3.14 billion in 2005. Mobile and Embedded Devices, which saw revenue increase 44 percent, was our fastest-growing division in 2006. A Strategic Foundation for Growth In the year ahead-and the years to come-we expect many of our long-term investments to show a significant return in areas ranging from online advertising to digital communications, entertainment, and Internet television, even as our more mature businesses continue to generate significant revenue growth. To help ensure that our investments translate to growth and profitability, we are focusing on our opportunities in three specific ways: Strengthening core businesses: Windows Client, Information Worker, and Server and Tools remain our largest businesses. The 2007 releases of new versions of Windows and Office will drive continued growth for each of these groups. With Windows Vista, growth will come from new PC shipments, upgrades across our installed base, and the availability of new premium versions. The launch of the 2007 Office system and Exchange 2007 will help us grow as the market for business software and services expands. We also expect growth in the world's developing countries as their economies develop and they adopt global standards for intellectual property protection. In fiscal 2006, nearly 60 million PCs were sold with pirated versions of Windows. Our Windows Genuine Advantage program and agreements with PC manufacturers in China are just two examples of our commitment to ensuring that we realize the full value of our intellectual property. Meanwhile, innovative payment options like FlexGo, which enables people to finance their computer use on a pay-as-you-go basis, will help us reach new consumers in emerging markets around the world. Succeeding in adjacent businesses: In 2007, we will deliver a wave of new products, services, and technologies that will position us to take advantage of a wide range of high-growth opportunities. One example is unified communications, our vision for bringing together telephony, e-mail, instant messaging, mobile devices, and Web conferencing, in order to streamline the way we communicate at work. To help make this vision a reality, in June 2006 we created the Unified Communications Group in the Business Division. New enterprise information management tools will help knowledge workers create, find, use, and share business information quickly and effectively. These technologies promise to have a profound impact on productivity, creativity, and collaboration, and we believe they will have a significant impact on our future growth. In addition, we'll offer new security capabilities, improved management products, and new development tools. By bridging the gap between business processes and business practices, Microsoft Dynamics products position us to meet the fast-growing demand for better business process management systems. We recently entered the high-performance computing business. And we have new offerings and initiatives in industries such as life sciences and manufacturing. Entering new markets: We are excited by a number of important new opportunities that lie before us. With Xbox 360 and Xbox Live®, our online gaming and entertainment service, we are redefining how people create, deliver, and experience entertainment. We are also poised to see our long-term investment in Internet television begin to bear fruit as leading broadband service providers around the world prepare to deploy IPTV Edition, our digital television technology. Meanwhile, the number of customers using the Windows Mobile® and Windows embedded platforms is growing rapidly. Top Leading the Software Services Transformation Internet-based services are transforming the way people create, deploy, manage, and use information technology. We are deeply committed to playing a leadership role through our efforts to create the services platform for the next generation of applications, communications, and commerce. Across the company, software services are at the core of all of our development efforts. In 2006, we introduced Windows Live, which includes a wide range of personal Internet services and software, and Office Live, which provides small businesses with affordable Internet-based business services hosted by Microsoft. We rolled out new search services, including beta releases of Windows Live Search and Windows Live Academic Search. We introduced new and enhanced services for computer safety and computer maintenance (Windows Live SafetyCenter and Windows Live OneCare), communications (Windows Live Mail and Windows Live Messenger), and entertainment (Xbox Live). We also created Live Labs, an applied research program that targets Internet products and services. Because software services offer strong opportunities for growth, we will continue to refine and improve adCenter, our advertising engine for Windows Live, MSN®, and other Microsoft online services. We will roll out new service-based solutions, such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Live, which we announced in July 2006. We will also continue to build out our services infrastructure, providing new tools to help partners and businesses create and host services, and adding new data centers to meet growing consumer demand for services. Investing in Our Employees and Our Communities The cornerstone of our success has always been our ability to attract and retain the most talented employees from around the world. In May, we announced important changes to help us ensure that Microsoft continues to be one of the world’s best places to work. These changes will enable us to better reward and retain top talent, while providing a workplace that is positive, inclusive, and collaborative. We also continue to work to foster social and economic advancement for communities in developing nations through partnerships with public- and private-sector organizations. We support a broad range of efforts to expand access to technology, provide training that can give people the skills they need to thrive in today’s economy, and nurture local software economies that open the door to new opportunities and greater prosperity. In 2006, community learning centers supported by our Unlimited Potential program reached more than 14.5 million people in 100 countries. Through our Partners in Learning program, we helped provide information and communications technology curriculum and skills training to 42 million primary and secondary teachers and students in 101 countries. By 2010, we intend to provide technology training to 250 million people who were previously underserved by technology. Incredible Opportunities in the Decade Ahead In many ways, the founding of Microsoft 30 years ago was a critical catalyst for the creation of the software industry, the popularizations of the PC, and the rise of the information revolution. Today, it’s not just the PC that is changing the world. Software is everywhere. It is revolutionizing the telephone and transforming the way we watch television. It ties businesses to customers and partners in new ways. It links students to vast collections of information stored around the world. It connects hundreds of millions of people across the globe to incredible economic, social, and cultural opportunities. As thrilling as the last 30 years have been, we think the next 10 years promise to be the most exciting in the history of Microsoft and our industry as a whole. We believe strongly that everything this company has delivered to date is really just the foundation for the truly profound changes we will see during the next 10 years. Because software is more central every day to the way we work, communicate, learn, and play, we believe no company is better positioned than Microsoft to thrive in the coming decade. We are deeply inspired by the incredible opportunities that lie ahead for our company. It is your support that enables us to continue to pursue these opportunities. Thank you."
2007,MICROSOFT,"Fiscal 2007 was an important and very successful year for Microsoft. Fueled by the launches of new versions of our flagship Microsoft® Windows® and Office products, the rollout of the biggest wave of business software in company history, and excellent momentum across a broad range of markets, we reached a significant milestone in 2007 when we surpassed $50 billion in revenue. For the year, revenue reached $51.12 billion, a 15 percent increase over fiscal 2006. Operating income totaled $18.52 billion, a jump of $2.05 billion compared with the previous year. During 2007, we returned $31 billion in cash to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Results such as these cap a remarkable run that has seen profit double and revenue nearly double over the past five years. During that time, we have also returned more than $100 billion to shareholders. Fiscal 2007 saw many successful product launches, led by the release of Windows Vista®, the newest version of our desktop operating system. In fiscal 2007, we sold more than 55 million Windows Vista licenses. The 2007 Microsoft Office system also enjoyed an extremely successful launch, enabling us to sell more than 71 million Microsoft Office licenses in fiscal 2007. Other important launches included the business security product Microsoft Forefront™, the Microsoft System Center family of IT management solutions, and new versions of many of our Microsoft Dynamics™ business solutions. We also launched Zune™, our digital and music entertainment device; released Microsoft Windows Mobile® 6; and introduced Microsoft Silverlight, which enables developers to create rich, interactive media experiences and applications for the Web. During 2007, we acquired the global digital marketing company aQuantive. Valued at approximately $6 billion, it marks the largest acquisition in Microsoft’s history. aQuantive’s market-leading technology and its decade-long relationships with publishers and advertisers combined with our adCenter advertising platform will enable us to offer a world-class Internet-wide advertising platform along with tools, sales, support, and syndication to agencies, advertisers, and publishers. We also made a number of other strategic acquisitions, including Tellme Networks, a leading provider of voice services for directory assistance, enterprise customer service, and mobile search;  ScreenTonic, a pioneer in mobile advertising; and Medstory, which develops Web search technology for health information. Long-Term Success Built on Broad Innovation and Global Talent In 2007, we continued our 30-year commitment to innovation by investing $7.12 billion in research and development. The value of our investment in research and development can be seen in new products such as Microsoft Surface™, which provides a groundbreaking tabletop computing experience that lets people interact with digital content through natural gestures and touch, and Microsoft Robotics Studio, our revolutionary software development kit for the robotics industry. It also is evident in more established products such as the 2007 Microsoft Office system, where the new Office Ribbon interface is transforming the way people use productivity software. The foundation for innovation at Microsoft is a work force that consists of the top talent from around the world. In a time of intense competition for talent in our industry, 2007 was one of the best recruiting years in company history. Around the globe, we hired great people for technical, sales, marketing, and support roles, and added new research and development facilities so we can continue to attract the world’s best and brightest. Equally important, we are making industry-leading investments in career development and workplace enhancements so our employees have the right tools and incentives to drive the company forward. Top Building New Competencies in Consumer Technology and the Services Transformation One essential difference between Microsoft and any other company in this industry is our willingness to enter new markets and embrace disruptive business trends. Seventeen years ago, we began to diversify our company by expanding beyond the desktop and entering the enterprise server software market. Today, server software is a $11.18 billion business for Microsoft. This kind of long-term commitment and vision has enabled Microsoft to create an impressive portfolio of desktop and enterprise products that have seen strong growth during the past five years. Since fiscal 2002, for example, Microsoft SQL Server™ revenue has grown by an annual average of 28 percent, Microsoft Dynamics — which became a $1 billion business in 2007 — has grown 27 percent, and Microsoft Office SharePoint® Server has grown by 67 percent. Now we are focused on diversifying once again as we pursue opportunities in consumer technology. To build on the strength we have in the consumer marketplace with Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Xbox 360™, Microsoft Windows Live™, Windows Mobile, and Zune, we are focused on delivering products that are compelling and cutting edge in terms of design as well as features and functionality. As part of our emphasis on success in consumer technologies, we are also working to define the next era of consumer electronics. In the past, consumer electronics was a hardware-centric business; today, the real innovation in consumer electronics devices lies in the software that powers them. This is creating new opportunities for us to deliver end-to-end experiences that no other company can match. Underlying our opportunities in consumer technologies, and in all of our businesses, is a companywide commitment to fully embrace software plus services. Software plus services enables us to combine the advantages of Internet-based services — software that resides on the Internet, is downloaded quickly for each use, and is accessed through a Web browser — with the power of desktop and server software. Software plus services represents the single biggest opportunity across every one of our businesses. Our software-plus-services approach will enable us to deliver new experiences to end users and new value to businesses as we combine the richness of our desktop software with the breadth of our online assets, and the control and security of our enterprise software with the flexibility and mobility of our consumer devices. In fiscal 2007, we made important progress in software plus services with the introduction of Windows Live Spaces and Windows Live for Mobile, and the release from beta of Windows Live Search, Windows Live.com, Windows Live Local Search and Office Live. We also introduced new developer tools such as Silverlight, Popfly and the Microsoft .NET 3.0 Framework. In the coming year as we continue to build out our services platform, we will bring a broad range of new products and service offerings to market that target the needs of large enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. Delivering More Value Around the World on the Desktop and the Server Although we enjoyed strong success in 2007 with the launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system, we see strong opportunities for growth by delivering more value per customer. With the planned releases in fiscal 2008 of Windows Server® 2008, SQL Server 2008, and Visual Studio® 2008, and the opportunity to provide additional value in security, messaging, systems management and collaboration, we are well-positioned to build on our strength with businesses of all sizes. We will also continue to pursue new opportunities in high-performance computing, unified communications, healthcare and business intelligence. Around the world, we’re seeing excellent growth in many emerging markets as more and more people begin to participate in the global knowledge economy. For example, in Russia and Vietnam our revenue grew in excess of 70 percent in 2007. Other emerging markets that saw impressive growth included India, China, and Brazil, which all delivered revenue growth that topped 40 percent. Growth was strong in many developed markets as well, with Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and Australia each exceeding revenue growth of 25 percent. All told, revenue jumped 25 percent or more in 46 countries in 2007. Investing in Communities, Fostering Diversity Using the power of technology to help people around the world achieve their potential is central to our mission, and we continue to work to foster social and economic advancement for communities through partnerships with public- and private-sector organizations. In April, we announced the expansion of Unlimited Potential and unveiled a new commitment to help close the digital divide by creating new products and programs that will help bring social and economic opportunity to the estimated 5 billion people who are not yet realizing the benefits of technology. Unlimited Potential is focused on delivering relevant, accessible and affordable solutions that will help transform education, foster local innovation, and help create jobs and opportunities. We believe Microsoft can have the greatest impact in these three areas, creating a continuous cycle of sustained social and economic opportunity. During fiscal 2007, community technology skills centers supported by Unlimited Potential reached more than 46 million people. Through our Partners in Learning program, we have helped provide information and communications technology curriculum and skills training to more than 71 million primary and secondary teachers and students in 101 countries. At Microsoft, diversity and inclusion are also core values and we strive to be the industry leader in helping women and minorities realize their potential. Within the company, we promote diversity at every level of the organization, and in 2007, the number of women in senior executive positions increased more than 20 percent. We’re also working to encourage more women and minorities to enter the technology industry through programs such as DigiGirlz, which provides high school girls with opportunities to learn about careers in technology and take advantage of hands-on technology workshops. And we’re committed to working in partnership with minority- and women-focused organizations to help bring technology to diverse communities. One example is a $5 million technology grant to the National Urban League. Top A New Era of Innovation and Change Microsoft was founded with the dream of putting a computer on every desk and in every home, and for more than 30 years our software has played a vital role in the positive cycle of innovation and progress that has given rise to incredible new ways to communicate, share ideas, manage our businesses, and much more. It’s amazing to look back and see how much progress we have made in the past three decades. But it’s even more inspiring to look ahead and imagine a world where that dream embraces every country in every part of the globe, empowering billions more people to participate in the knowledge economy. As this happens, new ideas will emerge, new businesses will be launched, and important new advances will be made in science and medicine. The result will be a wave of new innovations that will continue to make our lives richer, more productive and more fulfilling. Because software is the foundation for the profound changes that lie ahead, Microsoft is in an ideal position to take advantage of the incredible opportunities that lie before us. It is your continued support that enables us to pursue these opportunities. Thank you."
2008,MICROSOFT,"Fiscal 2008 was a successful year for Microsoft that saw the company deliver outstanding financial results, introduce significant innovations across the breadth of our product portfolio, and make key investments that position the company for strong future growth. Thanks to the continued success of our core Windows and Office businesses, and double-digit growth in all of our business groups, revenue jumped to $60.4 billion in fiscal 2008, an increase of 18 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income grew by 21 percent, reaching $22.5 billion for the year. Earnings per share reached $1.87. We returned $16.5 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Throughout fiscal 2008 we saw strong adoption of Windows Vista, which has sold more than 180 million licenses, and the 2007 Microsoft Office system, which has sold more than 120 million licenses. Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 passed the 100 million mark for licenses sold and recorded more than $1 billion in revenue. During the year, we brought a wide range of new innovations to market. We launched Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. We released Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and introduced advances in our search and online advertising technologies. We rolled out Surface—a groundbreaking new device that transforms a tabletop into a computing surface that enables people to interact with digital content using gestures, touch, and physical objects—in a number of retail and hotel locations. We unveiled new products and services for the healthcare industry. We announced important changes to our technology and business practices to increase the openness of our products and drive greater interoperability and choice for developers, partners, customers, and competitors. We also announced important strategic acquisitions to strengthen our offerings in key markets and add to our broad innovation portfolio. The acquisitions of AdECN, Rapt, and YaData, for example, bring leading-edge capabilities for advertisers and publishers to our advertising platform. With the acquisitions of Multimap, Fast Search & Transfer, and Farecast, we added important new technologies to our consumer and enterprise search services. As part of our mobile computing initiatives, we acquired Musiwave, a leading provider of mobile music entertainment services; Danger, which provides software and services that power consumer handsets; and MobiComp, a pioneer in mobile data backup and restoration. By acquiring Calista Technologies and Kidaro, we continue to position ourselves as a leader in the critical market for virtualization. In February 2008, we submitted a proposal to acquire Yahoo!. The proposed transaction was designed to accelerate our strategy in online search and advertising. After careful consideration, we determined that the economics of the deal terms demanded by Yahoo! and the need to move forward quickly in partnership on regulatory review and to integrate the two companies meant that the deal was no longer in the best interest of our shareholders. Although we withdrew our offer, we remain committed to being a leader in online search and advertising—we have the right people in place and we continue to make investments that will enable us to succeed. Transformation Through Innovation At the heart of our success lies our commitment to innovation. No company in our industry invests more in research and development or has the same depth and breadth of talented researchers, scientists, and engineers working across the globe to create new technology breakthroughs. In 2008, we invested $8.2 billion in research and development, an increase of almost 15 percent compared with fiscal 2007. During the year, we opened a new software development center in Vancouver, British Columbia; established the Microsoft Embedded Systems Development Center in Aachen, Germany; and launched the Internet Services Research Center within Microsoft Research in Redmond, Wash. We also opened Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, Mass. The company’s sixth major research facility, Microsoft Research New England brings computer scientists and social scientists together to develop new computing and online experiences. Across our products and technologies, we introduced compelling innovations in fiscal 2008 that deliver valuable new capabilities to our customers. With the release of Windows Server 2008, we introduced Microsoft Hyper-V, a technology that enables multiple operating systems to run on a single computer. Called virtualization, this approach is helping companies reduce costs and energy consumption and it is transforming the way computing capabilities are delivered and managed. The availability of Hyper-V is just one of the ways we made significant strides toward realizing our vision for dynamic IT systems that have the flexibility and intelligence to automatically adjust to changing business conditions. New Microsoft Systems Center products released in fiscal 2008 are helping IT organizations optimize business processes and improve the delivery of computing services. We also continue to focus on the companywide effort to embrace software plus services and deliver breakthroughs that combine the power of desktop and server software with the flexibility of Internet-based services. In fiscal 2008, we made significant improvements to our core search technology through advances in our search algorithms, better query refinement, and enhanced understanding of query intent. New vertical search categories improve search results for commerce, entertainment, shopping, local search, and health queries. Live Search for Windows Mobile added new features for mobile users, such as voice input and dynamic rerouting of driving directions based on real-time traffic information. Microsoft Search Server Express 2008 optimizes search for business data. Our efforts in software plus services extend far beyond search. In fiscal 2008 we announced a new set of Online Services that provide mission critical services-enabled products for organizations with advanced IT capabilities. Our Online Services—including Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft SharePoint Online, Microsoft Office Communications Online, and Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online—provide customers with the flexibility to deploy and manage business application internally, or have them hosted by Microsoft partners or by Microsoft. To help developers and Web designers create the next generation of experiences and applications for the Web and for Windows, we also rolled out Microsoft Expression 2 and released a beta version of Microsoft Silverlight 2 in 2008. Other innovative products introduced in fiscal 2008 included Microsoft Windows HPC Server 2008, a server operating system designed for the fast-growing high-performance computing market, and WorldWide Telescope, a Web application that enables people to explore the universe through their computers. Emerging Opportunities and Markets Fiscal 2008 saw strong growth across our businesses as we continue to focus on important new opportunities in a wide range of markets. For example, revenue from our Entertainment and Devices Division grew by 34 percent as investments in consumer technologies yielded strong benefits. For the year, Entertainment and Devices operating revenue reached $8.1 billion, thanks to excellent momentum from the Xbox 360 console, which has sold more than 19 million units, and Xbox Live, which has more than 12 million members. “Halo 3” topped $300 million in sales in just its first week of availability. We see important opportunities in the digitization of communications and we introduced new unified communications software including Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007, Microsoft Office Communicator 2007, and Microsoft Live Meeting to help companies streamline workplace communications. We launched Microsoft Office PerformancePoint Server 2007, which delivers new technologies that make business intelligence accessible and easy to use for people at every level of an organization. Healthcare is another important opportunity and in fiscal 2008 we introduced Microsoft HealthVault and the Microsoft Amalga Family of Health Enterprise Systems. HealthVault provides a platform for services and applications that will enable people to better manage their health information. Amalga is a portfolio of enterprise-class solutions that span clinical, operational, and financial functions within healthcare. Together, these products position Microsoft as a leader in the market for digital technology innovations that improve healthcare delivery. Online services and online advertising represent enormous opportunities for the company as well, and we continue to invest in research and development as we work to reinvent search through innovations in the user experience and in business models, with initiatives such as Microsoft Live Search cashback, which offers ad-funded rebates to consumers. During fiscal 2008, the acquisition of aQuantive and improvements to our advertiser and publisher solutions resulted in a 31 percent increase in online advertising revenue. One of our great strengths is the global nature of our business and we saw significant growth in a number of key emerging markets. In the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), revenue was up 54 percent. In addition to Russia, we saw strong growth across Central and Eastern Europe, where revenue increased 64 percent in fiscal 2008. Driven by positive results in Brazil, Latin America recorded an increase of nearly 30 percent. We also saw strong revenue growth in many developed countries, including Norway, Spain, Australia, Canada, and Germany, which all recorded revenue growth of 25 percent or more. All told, we saw 25 percent growth or better in 45 countries in fiscal 2008. Supporting Communities and Diversity Using the power of technology to help communities thrive and enable people around the world to achieve their potential remains central to our mission. In 2007, we announced the expansion of Unlimited Potential as the focus of our efforts to help close the digital divide for the estimated 5 billion people who are not yet realizing the benefits of information technology. One example of the progress we made in fiscal 2008 was the announcement that our Partners in Learning program has reached more than 100 million teachers and students in 101 countries. Diversity and inclusion are also core values at Microsoft. Across the company, we seek to promote diversity at every level and in everything we do. We’re working to encourage women and minorities to enter the technology industry through programs such as DigiGirlz, which help high school girls learn about careers in technology. And we’re committed to working with minority- and women-focused organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers to help bring technology to diverse communities. Strong Leadership Focused on Future Growth As we head into a new fiscal year, we believe that Microsoft is ideally positioned to drive strong growth in 2009 and beyond. We have excellent momentum and a great pipeline of products and technologies. Even more important, we have great people at every level, including strong leaders who have the experience and strategic insight to turn the opportunities that lie ahead of us into even greater success in the future. With Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie and Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie guiding the company’s technical strategy and a new generation of leaders stepping up to lead in areas such as online advertising, search, business strategy, and marketing, we look forward to delivering innovative products and services that improve people’s lives and create new opportunities for Microsoft, our customers, and our partners. For more than 30 years, Microsoft has enjoyed tremendous success by delivering key innovations that have revolutionized the way people communicate, share ideas, manage their businesses, and much more. Today, we’re in the midst of one of the most exciting periods in the history of our industry. Computing continues to become more powerful, more portable, and more affordable. Content, communications, and media are shifting entirely to digital formats. The combination of software plus services is transforming the way we create and deliver computing experiences. We are inspired by the opportunities we have to use the power of digital technology to continue to change the world for the better. It is your support that enables us to pursue these incredible opportunities. Thank you."
2009,MICROSOFT,"A worldwide economic recession that created the most difficult business environment since the Great Depression made fiscal 2009 a challenging year for Microsoft Corp. But thanks to our fiscal strength and prudent approach to investment, a strong pipeline of products, and a renewed focus on efficiency, we responded to the changing economic environment with speed and success. Fiscal 2009 was also a year in which the company made important progress in key areas of product development and technology innovation that position us for strong growth in the years ahead. The global recession had a major impact on the financial performance of companies around the world in virtually every industry in 2009, and Microsoft was no exception. As consumers and businesses reset their spending at lower levels, PC sales and corporate IT investments fell. As a result, Microsoft saw its first-ever drop in annual revenue, from $60.4 billion in fiscal 2008 to $58.4 billion in fiscal 2009, a decline of 3 percent. Operating income was $20.4 billion, down 9 percent. Earnings per share fell 13 percent to $1.62. Despite the difficult economic conditions, we introduced an impressive range of innovative new software to the marketplace. Fiscal 2009 saw the successful launch of key products including Microsoft® SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Internet Explorer® 8, and Bing, the newest version of our Web search technology. With Silverlight™ 2, Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite, Microsoft Exchange Online, and Microsoft SharePoint® Online we strengthened our position as a leader in software plus services and cloud computing. New and updated offerings for business customers included Windows® Small Business Server 2008, Windows Essential Business Server 2008, and Microsoft BizTalk®Server 2009. We also delivered pioneering new products that are fundamentally changing the way people use digital technology, including Microsoft Photosynth™, Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio 2008, and Microsoft Amalga™ Life Sciences 2009. During fiscal 2009, we made a number of strategic acquisitions, including the interactive online gaming company BigPark; DATAllegro, a provider of breakthrough data warehouse technologies; and Zoomix, which develops software that automates the delivery and synchronization of enterprise data. We also acquired Powerset, a pioneer of the use of natural language processing in online search, and Greenfield Online, a leader in comparison shopping technology. A Strong Response to a Difficult Economic Climate The global recession created difficult challenges for Microsoft, and for our industry as a whole. But it also created significant opportunities. Because we offer a wide range of affordable, high-quality products today that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs, Microsoft is well-positioned to weather the economic downturn and gain market share. As the global economy begins to recover, this will create new opportunities to increase revenue. In addition, employees and company leaders responded to the economic downturn by sharpening Microsoft’s focus on our most important opportunities for growth now and in the future, and on finding opportunities to cut costs and use resources more effectively. All told, we reduced expenses by more than $3 billion compared with our original fiscal 2009 plan and we remain committed to controlling costs in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, we also made important adjustments to our cost structure through strategic job eliminations. The decision to eliminate up to 5,000 jobs was very difficult, but it was the right move because it has enabled us to focus resources where they can deliver the greatest results for the company. And we continue to recruit and hire the best talent from around the globe. The company’s fiscal strength was an important factor in Microsoft’s ability to successfully weather the difficult financial markets that prevailed for most of fiscal 2009. Thanks to our excellent financial position, we announced a new $40 billion program in early fiscal 2009 to repurchase shares of our stock and increased the quarterly dividend. We also returned nearly $14 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the fiscal year. We also took advantage of favorable market conditions in fiscal 2009 to authorize a $3.75 billion debt offering. As part of the debt authorization, Microsoft received a AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor’s, becoming the first U.S. corporation in a decade to be assigned S&P’s highest rating. These steps have made Microsoft a stronger company — we are more efficient, agile, and competitive today than we were before the recession began. Commitment to Innovation and an Unprecedented Pipeline of Products The recession has not changed our fundamental approach to our business. Technological innovation has always been the foundation of Microsoft’s growth and success. We invest more in research and development to drive innovation than any other company in our industry, and the breadth and depth of our engineering and scientific talent is unmatched. Despite the difficult economic conditions, we maintained our commitment to smart, long-term investment in research and development in fiscal 2009. During the year, we opened a new Microsoft Research lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and we launched our new Search Technology Center in Europe. All told, we invested $9 billion in research and development in fiscal 2009, an increase of about 10 percent. Fiscal year 2009 saw many examples of how our emphasis on long-term innovation delivers value to customers and the company. In October, we introduced technical previews of Windows Azure, our new operating system for cloud computing, and the Azure Services Platform, which is a comprehensive set of storage, computing, and networking infrastructure services. These technologies — which allow developers to build applications that enable people to store and share information easily and securely in the cloud and access it on any device from any location — are key to Microsoft’s software plus services strategy and our future success. Another example is Bing, which goes beyond what people have come to think of as search by delivering a powerful set of tools that enable people to make faster, more informed decisions. We also unveiled “Project Natal” for Xbox 360®. This groundbreaking technology uses special sensors and software to track body movements, recognize faces, and respond to spoken directions and even changes in tone of voice. The value of our approach can also be seen in the unprecedented pipeline of innovative products that reached significant development milestones during fiscal 2009 and are scheduled to be released in fiscal 2010. In the coming year, we’ll roll out Windows 7, Office 2010, Windows Azure, Windows Server® 2008 R2, Windows Mobile® 6.5, and Silverlight 3.0. These are all important releases for the company, our partners, and our customers. Windows 7, in particular, is highly anticipated. This new version of our flagship desktop operating system has already received excellent reviews from the media, industry analysts, and thousands of customers who have tested pre-release versions. Driving Future Transformation Even as we moved forward with development of a new generation of software products in fiscal 2009 for release in fiscal 2010, scientists and engineers at Microsoft Research, Live Labs, Office Labs and other groups at Microsoft continued to focus on long-term research aimed at pioneering the next generation of breakthrough technologies. Some of the areas that we believe offer the most important opportunities to deliver value and benefit to customers and partners while driving future profitable growth for Microsoft include: Cloud computing and software plus services: The ability to combine the power of desktop and server software with the reach of the Internet is creating important opportunities for growth in almost every one of our businesses. We are focused on delivering end-to-end experiences that connect users to information, communications, entertainment, and people in new and compelling ways across their lives at home, at work, and the broadest-possible range of mobile scenarios. Natural user interfaces: The next few years will also see dramatic changes in the way people interact with technology, as touch, gestures, handwriting, and speech recognition become a normal part of how we control devices. This will make technology more accessible and simpler to use and will create opportunities to reach new markets and deliver new kinds of computing experiences. Natural language processing: As computing power increases, our ability to build software that understands users’ intentions based on what they have done in the past and then anticipate their future needs is rapidly improving. This will enable us to deliver a new generation of software that has the knowledge and intelligence to respond to simple natural language input and quickly carry out complex tasks in a way that accurately reflects users’ needs and preferences. New scenario innovation: We are entering a period where continuing improvement in the power of computers and devices and the speed and ubiquity of networks is creating opportunities to address significant global issues including healthcare, environmental sustainability, and education. Software that enables people without specialized programming skills to quickly create models and simulations will transform scientific research and have a dramatic impact on a wide range of industries, from financial services, to engineering, aerospace, manufacturing, more. In the coming years, we will also see a dramatic transformation in the way people access and use digital technology at home, at work, and while traveling. Ubiquitous connectivity across devices will enable people to utilize data, applications, and social networks anywhere and at anytime. Rich client productivity tools, Web-based applications, unified communication solutions, and integrated business productivity servers and services will open the door to dramatic productivity gains. A new generation of software and services for the enterprise will enable information technology departments to automate the management and delivery of services and capabilities to employees and customers to dynamically match changing business requirements. Investing in Communities and Fostering Opportunity Our commitment to using the power of technology to help communities thrive and enable people around the world achieve their potential continues to drive our work at Microsoft. One of our most important goals is to expand access to the benefits of digital technology beyond the 1 billion people who use computers on a regular basis today. We do this through Unlimited Potential, which offers programs such as the one that supports 37,000 technology training centers in 102 countries; and Partners in Learning, which has helped provide access to technology and technology training for more than 4 million teachers and 90 million students in over 100 countries. We also offer special versions of our development software to students and entrepreneurs. Through DreamSpark™, high school and college students around the world can use and learn about cutting-edge software and Internet development technologies for free. In fiscal 2009, we launched BizSpark™, which provides startup companies with fast and easy access to Microsoft development tools and server products with no upfront costs, and offers special technical support and marketing programs that can help them succeed. In fiscal 2009, we also launched Elevate America, a program designed to help U.S. workers who have been affected by the economic recession gain the skills needed to succeed in a technology- and information-driven economy. A Catalyst for Productivity A difficult economic climate made fiscal 2009 a challenging year for Microsoft and our entire industry. But our core values — fiscal conservatism, a long-term approach to research and development, and a deep commitment to the power of technology to improve people’s lives — have served the company well. Although the economic climate is likely to remain challenging in fiscal 2010, our opportunities are greater than ever. We believe future economic growth around the world will be driven by productivity gains that come from continuing advances in software and digital technology. Microsoft is in a great position to lead the way. With a superb pipeline of products and ongoing long-term investments in key technology areas such as cloud computing, natural user interfaces, scientific computing, and much more, we will continue to deliver innovations that help people lead richer, more productive, more creative, and more connected lives. Your support enables us to pursue these opportunities to help people around the globe to achieve their potential. Thank you."
2010,MICROSOFT,"A year ago in my 2009 annual letter to shareholders, I reflected on the impact of the global recession and the difficulties that all businesses faced in responding to one of the most challenging economic environments in the past 80 years. Now, just 12 months later, I’m gratified to report that fiscal 2010 was a year of remarkable accomplishments. We reported record revenue and earnings per share, showed outstanding momentum across all our businesses, maintained a disciplined approach to controlling costs, and proved our deep commitment to smart investments in technology innovation. As I look back on fiscal 2010, there are three critical areas that lay the foundation for long-term growth and sustained future success: 1. Our commitment to cloud computing 2. A product portfolio that is stronger than ever 3. Our record-setting financial performance Leading the Cloud Transformation Throughout the history of the computing industry, we have seen long stretches of steady incremental improvement, punctuated by waves of intense transformation and change. Key breakthroughs – the microprocessor in the 1970s, the graphical user interface in the 1980s, and the Internet in the 1990s – revolutionized the role that information technology plays in how we manage information, run our businesses and share experiences, bringing dramatic positive change to the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Today, with the emergence of cloud computing, we’re in the midst of the next great wave of transformation and change. The cloud is revolutionizing computing by linking the computing devices people have at hand to the processing and storage capacity of massive datacenters, transforming computing from a constrained resource into a nearly limitless platform for connecting people to the information they need, no matter where they are or what they are doing. This has profound implications for the way people use technology across their lives to work, learn, communicate, and have fun. With our unique position in the industry, it’s not enough just to ride this great wave – we intend to grow it and shape it. This is why we’ve made a company-wide commitment to Microsoft’s solutions, bringing the benefits of the cloud to the billion people who use computing today and the billions more who will gain access to digital technology for the first time in the years ahead. In fiscal 2010, Microsoft invested $8.7 billion in research and development, with most of that devoted to cloud technologies. Today, roughly 70 percent of Microsoft’s 40,000 engineers work on cloud-related products and services, and in fiscal 2011 that number will grow to nearly 90 percent. With the first version of Hotmail®, Microsoft started investing in cloud computing more than 15 years ago. Today, our consumer cloud technologies and services support hundreds of millions of customers around the globe. More than 300 million people use Windows Live® Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger to send nearly 10 billion messages every day. This year, our Xbox LIVE® subscription base surpassed 25 million subscribers, a growth of over 20 percent from last year. On the business side, not only are we offering online versions of our products, such as Microsoft Dynamics® CRM Online, Microsoft® Office 2010, SharePoint® Online, Exchange Online and Office Communications Online, but we are delivering entirely new cloud computing platform innovations such as Windows Azure™, SQL Azure™ and Windows Intune™. The Windows Azure Platform Appliance is a groundbreaking product that will enable service providers, large enterprises and governments to achieve breakthrough datacenter efficiency through innovative power, cooling and automation technologies. Currently, over 10,000 corporate customers have adopted Windows Azure and thousands of business and government entities representing millions of people have purchased Microsoft’s online productivity services to improve productivity and reduce costs. Customers include 13 of the top 20 global telecom firms, 15 of the top 20 global banks and 16 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies. Together, these technologies, products, and services enable us to do something no other company can do – deliver cloud solutions that span the complete range of business needs our customers have. At Microsoft, we firmly believe the impact of cloud computing will be as big as – or bigger than – the previous waves of technology change. The opportunities cloud computing will create for our customers, our partners and our company will be immense. When it comes to the cloud, “we’re all in.” Delivering New Advances Across Our Product Portfolio Fiscal 2010 was one of the strongest years in company history for the range and quality of the product advances that we delivered. At the top of the list is Windows® 7. Faster, simpler, and easier to use, it enables people to work the way they want to and more easily than ever before. Windows 7 has already sold 175 million copies, making it the fastest-selling operating system in history. Fiscal 2010 also saw updates of many of our Windows Live cloud services, which are redefining how people socialize, communicate and share experiences. Late in fiscal 2010, we released Office 2010 with Office Web Apps. This newest version of our world-leading productivity software provides a unified experience that enables people to connect to their work and each other across the PC, phone and browser so they can get things done from almost anywhere. Even before its official launch date, Office 2010 had been downloaded by more than 9 million beta customers. In our Server & Tools Business, Windows Server®, SQL Server™ and Visual Studio® product advances all help IT professionals save time, reduce costs and build dynamic and efficient data centers. In our Online Services Division, we delivered several innovation advances in Bing™ throughout the year. Bing gained over 4 points of share during the year and feedback from customers and industry analysts has been positive. We are well along the way on the Yahoo/Bing search integration we announced last July and expect the U.S. integration to be completed this fiscal year. Along with these releases, in fiscal 2010 we laid the groundwork for several products that will continue to deliver innovation over the next year. This holiday season we’ll roll out Kinect™ for Xbox 360®, a new experience that incorporates video and audio sensors to empower people to use gestures and voice commands to play games and enjoy other kinds of TV entertainment – all without the need for a controller. We’ll also launch Windows® Phone 7, a completely new interface for phones that focuses on simplicity and a smart design that brings together the Web, apps and services into an integrated experience. This year, we’ll deliver the latest version of our browsing technology, Internet Explorer® 9, which is already winning rave reviews for its speed and performance. These products join a comprehensive portfolio of products that improve people’s lives and help businesses succeed. Record Financial Performance Our combination of focus, discipline and commitment in fiscal 2010 enabled us to achieve record financial results. For the year, revenue reached a record of $62.5 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income grew by 18 percent to $24.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share jumped 30 percent to $2.10 and we returned almost $16 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. These outstanding results reflect the strong product momentum across the entire company, and we achieved double-digit growth in every business segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. In addition, we grew operating income more quickly than overall revenue during each quarter of fiscal 2010, which shows that Microsoft has maintained a tight focus on controlling expenses. More than 35 years ago, Microsoft helped launch the first great wave of information technology transformation by creating the software that made the PC revolution possible. Today, with your support and our industry-leading cloud solutions, exciting product portfolio and strong financial performance, we’re playing a key role in delivering the tools and technologies that are making information technology more powerful, more useful, more affordable and more accessible. We’re thrilled and humbled to be a part of this process and we look forward to seeing the transformation that results. Thank you."
2011,MICROSOFT,"We've always believed that technology creates opportunities for people and organizations to achieve their dreams. This belief continues to drive us towards new inventions and new markets so we can impact the lives of billions of people around the world. The products and services this belief has inspired fueled our success in fiscal year 2011 and gives us confidence in what's ahead. In fiscal year 2011, we delivered record financial performance by growing revenue 12 percent to $69.9 billion. Thanks to our continued discipline and focus on managing costs and expenses, operating income grew at an even higher rate – 13 percent, to $27.2 billion. In addition, we returned $16.9 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, a 10 percent increase over the previous year. The best way to understand our results and the opportunities that lie ahead is to look at three areas: product innovation and momentum strategic partnerships and acquisitions big bets for the future Product Innovation and Momentum Microsoft continues to be the company that businesses look to for the software they need to boost productivity and operate with efficiency, effectiveness, and intelligence. Throughout fiscal 2011, we saw business spending increase and strong demand for Windows 7, Office 2010, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync, Microsoft Dynamics, Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server. Windows 7 and Office 2010 continue to sell at record rates. At the end of fiscal year 2011, more than 400 million Windows 7 licenses and 100 million Office 2010 licenses had been purchased by businesses and consumers. The rate of businesses moving to the cloud continues to accelerate. For many businesses, moving to the cloud is a journey, not a sudden transformation. They are moving to the cloud on their terms and often use hybrid solutions that include the cloud and their existing datacenter investments. The Windows Azure Platform allows businesses to connect existing investments and develop new applications reducing the time from concept to deployment with little upfront cost. Customers find our approach unique because we ultimately enable them to choose what's right for them. In June, we launched Office 365 – a new service where Office meets the cloud. Office 365 offers collaboration for businesses of all sizes – from the smallest neighborhood store to the largest global enterprise. It represents a culmination of the work we've been doing in the enterprise cloud space for more than 5 years. Because it is a subscription based cloud offering, with a variety of different service plans, businesses can choose the right plan for their needs, and get access to the best collaboration and productivity tools anywhere including Office, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync – a new technology that unites video and voice calls, instant messaging, and Web conferencing. Of the small businesses using Office 365, 80% have never purchased Exchange, SharePoint or Lync before and customers using Office 365 are reporting up to a 50% overall IT cost savings realized through increased efficiency. With hundreds of millions of businesses around the world striving to prosper and grow, we believe Office 365 can be an engine of growth for these businesses and us. Beyond the cloud, we also made significant strides with our consumer offerings against very tough competition. In November, we launched Kinect for Xbox 360 – called ""the fastest-selling consumer electronics device"" in history by Guinness World Records. Kinect creates a new form of entertainment by changing the way people interact with games, movies, and music simply by speaking and moving. Then in May, we announced how we'll continue the evolution of Xbox from a gaming console into an entertainment hub by increasing our content partnerships 10 fold and bringing live television to Xbox in the United States this holiday season. With millions of content choices, a new entertainment challenge arises – discovery. So, we also announced that we'll bring voice search to Xbox, using Bing and Kinect – simply say a movie, TV show, song or game and Xbox will find it. Bing made strong strides this year. It's redefining the way people find information and make decisions – Bing Internet search share grew over 30% in the United States during fiscal 2011, to 14.4 percent. It has also played a key role in making other products better like Windows, Windows Phone and soon Xbox. We also introduced the new Windows Phone. Based on a fundamentally new, modern design, this phone gives people an easier, quicker and more delightful experience. We are proud of the new Windows Phone and are thrilled with the feedback from our customers – nine out of ten say they would recommend it to a friend. We continued to innovate quickly on Windows Phone, and just eight months after the first version we delivered a major update that will be available this fall. Partnerships and Acquisitions Strategic partnerships and acquisitions have always played an important role in Microsoft's strategy for growth and technology leadership. Fiscal year 2011 saw a number of critical moves that will play a key role in our future growth. During the fall of 2010, we completed the integration of Yahoo! search with Bing, and by the close of fiscal year 2011, Bing and Yahoo! together powered more than one-quarter of all U.S. searches. In May, we announced a new partnership with Facebook that enables us to deliver personalized search results that are based on friends' opinions. This data helps people make decisions more quickly and easily based on recommendations that are personal, more relevant, and reflect the wisdom and experience of known and trusted friends. In February, we announced an important partnership with Nokia aimed at building a new mobile ecosystem that will pave the way for choice and opportunity for consumers, mobile network operators, and developers. Through this partnership, Nokia will primarily develop and sell Windows Phones as the two companies work together on mobile technology design, development, and marketing initiatives that in the next year will bring Windows Phones to a much wider range of market segments and geographies across a much broader range of price points. We announced in May our intention to acquire Skype, the world's leading provider of real-time Internet video and voice communications services and technology. Skype is a perfect fit with Microsoft's core vision to unleash our customers' productivity and creativity by making it easier for them to communicate and work together. With the acquisition of Skype and requisite regulatory approval, we'll connect hundreds of millions of people and provide them exciting new ways to communicate and create on PCs, phones, the Xbox, and through applications like Office and Lync. Big Bets for the Future At Microsoft, we believe the most engaging digital experiences will grow out of the combination of four things: smart devices, cloud-based services, natural forms of interaction between people and technology, and finally, people's imaginations. We will continue to create and sell great software that people use every day at work, at home and everywhere in between. Increasingly, the full value and benefit of software will be optimized and expressed in the services and devices that people use at work and in their personal lives. So increasingly, we will view ourselves as a devices and services company. We believe the number of devices on which software will run will increase dramatically. We'll continue to build some devices like the Xbox and work in close partnership with PC, tablet, phone, and other manufacturers around the world to design powerful and compelling devices that consumers love and businesses need. We are looking ahead to Windows 8 with confidence and excitement. We are creating a reimagined version of Windows that builds on the advancements in cloud computing, on touch interfaces and other natural ways to interact with technology. Without compromise, we will deliver the security, reliability and manageability businesses require, along with personalized and seamless connections to information, people, services, and applications across the variety of devices people use. For services, we'll continue betting on the cloud for both businesses and consumers. For businesses, we're focused on enabling all of our products for the cloud including continuing our work with Windows Azure, Office 365, and Microsoft Dynamics services. For consumers, we're focused on Skype, Bing, Windows Live and Xbox Live. We're also investing in natural ways for people to interact with technology. For example, we'll bring the advances of Kinect beyond entertainment to business, science, education and medicine by connecting it to the Windows PC and the Windows Phone. Bing will have a broad impact beyond search as we apply its understanding of the world's people and knowledge to scenarios that help individuals accomplish a task. Imagine that instead of trying to print a boarding pass by finding a website and typing in a confirmation code you could simply say ""print my boarding pass."" There are so many opportunities to fundamentally improve how we interact with the range of devices and services by pushing the capabilities of natural user interfaces. We'll continue to inspire and be inspired by the imaginations of more than 7 million Microsoft developers, our 600,000 and growing partner community and billions of customers who all think about how to personalize, extend and leverage Microsoft technology to achieve their dreams. As I said at the beginning, we have always believed that technology creates opportunities for people and organizations to achieve their dreams. We're excited about what we will be able to accomplish next year and beyond. Thank you for your continued support."
2012,MICROSOFT,"Last year was a big year — we delivered strong results, launched fantastic new products and services, and positioned Microsoft for an incredible future. For fiscal year 2012, revenue grew to a record $73.7 billion. We also maintained strong cost discipline resulting in cash flow from operations of $31.6 billion, an increase of 17 percent from the prior year. In addition, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. We delivered these results while preparing a pipeline of new and updated products that will launch in the year ahead. To best understand what we are about to deliver and what we're building toward, it's important to recognize a fundamental shift underway in our business and the areas of technology that we believe will drive the greatest opportunity in the future. Our Business: Devices and Services Last year in this letter I said that over time, the full value of our software will be seen and felt in how people use devices and services at work and in their personal lives. This is a significant shift, both in what we do and how we see ourselves — as a devices and services company. It impacts how we run the company, how we develop new experiences, and how we take products to market for both consumers and businesses. The work we have accomplished in the past year and the roadmap in front of us brings this to life. Devices With End-User Services We will continue to work with a vast ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows PCs, tablets and phones. We do this because our customers want great choices and we believe there is no way one size suits over 1.3 billion Windows users around the world. There will be times when we build specific devices for specific purposes, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and the recently announced Microsoft Surface. In all our work with partners and on our own devices, we will focus relentlessly on delivering delightful, seamless experiences across hardware, software and services. This means as we, with our partners, develop new Windows devices we'll build in services people want. Further, as we develop and update our consumer services, we'll do so in ways that take full advantage of hardware advances, that complement one another and that unify all the devices people use daily. So right out of the box, a customer will get a stunning device that is connected to unique communications, productivity and entertainment services from Microsoft as well as access to great services and applications from our partners and developers around the world. A great example of this shift is Windows 8. Windows 8 will come to market Oct. 26, 2012, with beautiful hardware that will light up with our consumer cloud services. Windows 8 unites the light, thin and fun aspects of a tablet with the power of a PC. It's beautiful, it's functional, and it's perfect for both personal and professional use. Xbox Music, Video, Games and SmartGlass apps make it possible to select a movie from a PC, start playing it on the TV, and finish watching it on a phone. SkyDrive, our cloud storage solution, effortlessly connects content across a user's devices. Bing's powerful search technologies in Windows 8 will help customers get more done. Skype has a beautiful new Windows 8 app and connects directly into the new Office. Office, too, is taking a major leap forward. The new Office was designed from the ground up for Windows 8 and takes full advantage of new mobile form factors with touch and pen capabilities. It unlocks new experiences for reading, note taking, meetings and communications and brings social directly into productivity and collaboration scenarios. The combination of a Windows 8 tablet with OneNote and SkyDrive has truly revolutionized how to take notes, annotate documents and share information. The ultimate experience with the new Office for both consumers and businesses will come when it is paired with a Windows 8 device and delivered as a cloud subscription service with Office 365. Services for the Enterprise Fantastic devices and services for end users will drive our enterprise businesses forward given the increasing influence employees have in the technology they use at work — a trend commonly referred to as the Consumerization of IT. It's one more reason Microsoft is committed to delivering devices and services that people love and businesses need. Today, businesses face a number of important opportunities and challenges. Enterprise IT departments are tasked with deploying technology that drives the business strategy forward. They decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative and satisfied. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. At the same time they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices. To address these opportunities, businesses turn to Microsoft. They count on our world-class business applications like Microsoft Dynamics, Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and our business intelligence solutions. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. And, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to Microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. All the online services people use today — both from Microsoft and other companies — run on servers in datacenters around the globe. The volume of Internet services used will continue to grow as people connect to the Internet from more devices for more purposes — fueling incredible opportunity in our server business. Unique to Microsoft, we continue to design and deliver world-class cloud solutions that allow our customers to move to the cloud on their terms. For example, a company can choose to deploy Office or Microsoft Dynamics on premises, as a cloud service or a combination of both. With Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure and System Center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner's datacenter or in Microsoft's datacenter with common security, management and administration across all environments, with ultimate flexibility and scale. Our business customers tell us these capabilities are critical to harnessing the power of the cloud so they can reach new levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth. Our Future: Big Opportunity There's a remarkable amount of opportunity ahead for Microsoft in both the next year and the next decade. As we enter this new era, there are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward — all of which start to show up in the devices and services launching this year. Leading the industry in these areas over the long term will translate to sustained growth well into the future. These focus areas include: Developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them including touch, gestures and speech. Making technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf instead of at our command with machine learning. Building and running cloud services in ways that unleash incredible new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. Firmly establishing one platform, Windows, across the PC, tablet, phone, server and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advancements to market. Delivering new scenarios with life-changing improvements in how people learn, work, play and interact with one another. We are uniquely positioned to lead in these areas given the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, as well as our large, global partner and customer base and the growing Windows ecosystem. It truly is a new era at Microsoft — an era of incredible opportunity for us, for the 8 million developers building apps for our devices, for the more than 640,000 partners worldwide and, most important, for the people and businesses using our products to reach their full potential. We see an unprecedented amount of opportunity for both this year and the long term. Although we still have a lot of hard work ahead, our products are generating excitement. And when I pause to reflect on how far we've come over the past few years and how much further we'll go in the next one, I couldn't be more excited and optimistic. As always, thank you for your support."
2013,MICROSOFT,"This is a unique letter for me — the last shareholder letter I will write as the CEO of the company I love. We have always believed that technology will unleash human potential and that is why I have come to work every day with a heart full of passion for more than 30 years. Fiscal Year 2013 was a pivotal year for Microsoft in every sense of the word. Last year in my letter to you I declared a fundamental shift in our business to a devices and services company. This transformation impacts how we run the company, how we develop new experiences, and how we take products to market for both consumers and businesses. This past year we took the first big bold steps forward in our transformation and we did it while growing revenue to $77.8 billion (up 6 percent). In addition, we returned $12.3 billion (up 15 percent) to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. While we were able to grow revenue to a record level, our earnings results reflect investments as well as some of the challenges of undertaking a transformation of this magnitude. With this as backdrop, I’d like to summarize where we are now and where we’re headed, because it helps explain why I’m so enthusiastic about the opportunity ahead. Our strategy: High-value activities enabled by a family of devices and services We are still in the early days of our transformation, yet we made strong progress in the past year launching devices and services that people love and businesses need. We brought Windows 8 to the world; we brought consistent user experiences to PCs, tablets, phones and Xbox; and we made important advancements to Windows Server, Windows Azure, Microsoft Dynamics and Office 365. We are proud of what we accomplished this year and continue to be passionate about delivering better devices and services more quickly. To increase innovation, capability, efficiency and speed we further sharpened our strategy, and in July 2013 we announced we are rallying behind a single strategy as One Microsoft. We declared that Microsoft’s focus going forward will be to create a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe at home, at work and on the go, for the activities they value most. Over time, our focus on high-value activities will generate amazing innovation and new areas of growth. What is a high-value activity? Think of the experiences people have every day that are most important to them — from communicating with a family member and researching a term paper to having serious fun and expressing ideas. In a business setting, high-value activities include experiences such as conducting meetings with colleagues in multiple locations, gaining insight from massive amounts of data and information, and interacting with customers. Microsoft will enable these types of high-value activities with a family of devices — from both Microsoft and our partners — as well as with our services. As we go to market, we will primarily monetize our high-value activities by leading with devices and enterprise services. In this model, our consumer services such as Bing and Skype will differentiate our devices and serve as an on-ramp to our enterprise services while generating some revenue from subscriptions and advertising. Enterprise services continue to be an area of great strength, growth and opportunity as businesses of all sizes look to Microsoft to help them move to the cloud, manage a growing number of devices, tap into big data and embrace new social capabilities. Executing and accelerating In the past year we took many bold steps forward in executing on our strategy. First, we are well underway in implementing the new organization structure announced in July. The teams are working together in new and exciting ways. The key change we made is deceptively simple but profoundly powerful: Instead of organizing our teams around individual products, we’ve organized by function, including, for example, engineering, sales, marketing and finance. It ensures we have one strategy and work as one team with one set of shared goals. Second, in September we announced we are purchasing Nokia’s Devices and Services business — including its smartphone and mobile phone businesses; award-winning engineering and design teams; manufacturing and assembly facilities around the world; and teams devoted to operations, sales, marketing and support. This is a signature event in our transformation and will bring together the best mobile device work of Microsoft and Nokia. It will accelerate our growth with Windows Phone while strengthening our overall device ecosystem and our opportunity. Third, in September, we also announced a new segment-reporting framework. We have five new reporting segments tightly aligned with our focus on delivering innovative devices and services for both our enterprise and consumer customers. This framework was designed to give valuable insight into our progress in the key transformations we are undertaking in our businesses to drive long-term growth. As I think about what’s ahead, I’m incredibly optimistic about what Microsoft will deliver. We are accelerating as we bring to market Windows 8.1 PCs and tablets with our partners, Surface 2, Xbox One and new phones; advance our enterprise services including Windows Server, Windows Azure, Microsoft Dynamics and Office 365; and innovate on new high-value activities. Moving forward With the decisions we’ve made this year, the strategy we’ve put in place, the organization we’ve designed, the world-class talent we have, and the devices and services we are creating, we are well-positioned to deliver growth and world-changing technology long into the future. We have seen incredible results in the past decade — delivering more than $200 billion in operating profit. I’m optimistic not only as the CEO but as an investor who treasures his Microsoft stock. Working at Microsoft has been a thrilling experience — we’ve changed the world and delivered record-setting success — and I know our best days are still ahead. Thank you for your support."
2014,MICROSOFT,"It is a humbling experience to write this letter to you as only the third CEO in Microsoft’s history. As I said when I took this role, I originally joined Microsoft to have an opportunity to change the world through technology and empower people to do amazing things. Many companies aspire to change the world, but very few have the talent, resources and perseverance of Microsoft. I believe this is a landmark moment for the company and for our industry as a whole. Cloud and mobile technologies are redefining how people work and play. Three billion people will soon be connected to Internet-enabled devices; 212 billion sensors will come online in a few short years; trillions will be spent in consumer and business technologies. But it’s not about technology for technology's sake! It’s our mission to enable the use of technology to realize the true potential of people, teams and organizations. As I shared in my email to employees in July, we will be the productivity and platform company for this mobile-first and cloud-first world. We will empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more. And we will accomplish this by building incredible Digital Work and Life Experiences, supported by our Cloud Operating System, the Device Operating System and Hardware platforms. In the same way that we aspired to and achieved our original vision of a PC on every desk and in every home, we will reinvent productivity. This clarity of purpose and boldness of our aspiration inspires me and all of us at Microsoft. We began to take steps toward this core focus last fiscal year. To drive our mobile strategy, we acquired Nokia’s Devices and Services business, creating an expanded Microsoft Devices Group that includes Nokia phones, Xbox hardware, Surface, Perceptive Pixel products and accessories. We also announced Office on iPad, which led to 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote — becoming many of the most popular applications in the Apple App Store. In addition, we introduced Cortana, a personal assistant built into Windows Phone 8.1 that learns and provides information proactively to users, while protecting their privacy. And we launched the Surface Pro 3, a groundbreaking new tablet built to replace your laptop. Finally, we provided Windows licenses at zero dollars for any original equipment manufacturer building a device less than nine inches in size, which we expect to drive an amazing mix of innovative, low-cost devices for consumers this year. We continued to build upon our success in the cloud. Commercial cloud revenue hit a $4.4 billion annual run-rate, making us an undisputed leader; we grew Hyper-V to 30.6 percent of the market, taking share from competitors; and we expanded our datacenter footprint into Australia, Brazil, Japan and China. We brought industry-leading in-memory technology to the new version of SQL Server 2014, and we launched two cloud-based services — the Enterprise Mobility Suite for handling identity and security on devices, and the Azure Intelligent Systems Service for managing the “Internet of Things.” Despite this busy year of new products and significant change for the company, we delivered strong results, including revenue of more than $86 billion, gross margin of nearly $60 billion and operating income of $27.8 billion. We also returned more than $15.7 billion in cash to our shareholders, a 27 percent increase from 2013. Looking forward, we have a rich product road map that positions us to thrive in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. For example, we recently launched Delve, an Office 365 cloud-based service that automatically brings relevant documents, data and other artifacts to workers. And we announced our intention to acquire Mojang the, Stockholm-based game developer of the popular “Minecraft” franchise, a game that spans PCs, consoles, tablets and mobile. We also plan to launch Skype Translator this fiscal year, which has the potential to dramatically break down language barriers in our communications. And, perhaps most important, we recently previewed new features and innovations in the next version of Windows, Windows 10. All of these new services and experiences will be underpinned by significant investments in our cloud strategy — including building more datacenters and increasing capacity in existing regions; expanding our hybrid cloud offerings with new releases of StorSimple, InMage and other products; and launching new cloud capabilities, such as Azure Machine Learning, an offering that has the potential to be game-changing in helping people mine data for predictions. As CEO, I am committed to ensuring Microsoft makes the most of this landmark moment. And, at the same time, it is equally important to evolve our culture — becoming more customer-obsessed across all our products, focusing on leading indicators like usage, and ensuring Microsoft continues to be the best place for smart, curious people to do great work. I believe reinventing productivity and building platforms that empower every person and organization on the planet to do more and achieve more is a huge undertaking. But it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on. We are ready again to change the world. Thank you for your continued support,"
2015,MICROSOFT,"It’s been a remarkable year for all of us at Microsoft, a year of change and opportunity for our company, our industry and the world. We as a company stand for deeply understanding the needs of customers, translating that understanding into products that people love and ultimately into the success our customers have with our products. It’s that last part that is our key motivation. The entire Microsoft team is inspired to bring their best ideas and efforts every day to build products people love, and to advance our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. And we’re seeing the impact. We sharpened our focus this past fiscal year, prioritizing our talent and investments in areas where we have differentiation and potential for growth. We executed with financial discipline, with revenue of $93.6 billion, $60.5 billion of gross margin, $18.2 billion in operating income and $12.2 billion in net income. And we significantly increased our total cash return to shareholders by nearly 50 percent to $23.3 billion. Signature We also made key decisions that are moving us forward as the company that builds best-in-class platforms and productivity services for our mobile-first, cloud-first world. We launched Windows 10 as a service that unites your experience across a wide range of devices with innovations that increase productivity and flexibility while remaining familiar. Surface is proving that consumers and businesses alike want a tablet that can replace their laptop. We achieved $3.6 billion in Surface revenue --equally gratifying is the fact that Surface won fans while also creating a new hardware category. We restructured our phone business, as we aligned our first-party hardware portfolio into the larger Windows ecosystem. Going forward we will focus on building premium, flagship phones for Windows fans and commercial customers. We delivered Office everywhere on all devices, and Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew to more than 15 million, adding nearly 10 million subscribers in the fiscal year. Commercial customers are rapidly adopting this service with seats growing by 74 percent. Azure cloud platform revenue and compute usage increased by over 100 percent in the fourth quarter year over year. We are gaining ground in business process applications with triple-digit growth of the Dynamics CRM Online installed base and the overall Dynamics business growing revenue by double digits. We delivered innovative new cloud services at an increasing pace spanning enterprise mobility, big data, cloud infrastructure and application developer services. In this year’s letter, I want to look forward and paint a picture of how we’re building on this momentum while also reflecting on what we’ve learned. Empowerment. Microsoft, since its founding, has stood for individual and organizational empowerment. What’s different about our company when compared with the industry is that we make things that help other people make things. We also help them make things happen. We are well poised to ignite a new revolution in which digital technologies democratize access to people across economic strata, organizations of all sizes, entrepreneurs, researchers and students everywhere. This is empowerment. To deliver on this promise of empowerment, we’ve galvanized around three interconnected ambitions that will, in turn, drive our segment financial reporting this fiscal year. 1) Reinvent productivity and business processes. We are helping customers be even more effective with their individual time, while bringing together the power of teams and entire organizations to drive business outcomes and success. Time is quickly becoming our scarcest commodity, and people and organizations need the right tools and services that help them achieve increasingly complex and challenging outcomes more quickly than ever. We are building an array of productivity, communications, collaboration and business process applications so that they are optimized for what our users want to achieve rather than being bound to any current product category definitions. We let you pick up any device and create, collaborate, communicate ordo business using our cloud services. We enable you to complete your sales order by connecting seamlessly to CRM data within Outlook. We enable you to co-author in real time a student paper with a classmate or an RFP response with colleagues across your organization. We empower transparent communications and discovery of enterprise knowledge using tools such as Yammer, Delve and Power BI. Skype and Skype for Business enable you to have effective meetings with customers, partners and colleagues anywhere, anytime. Here is a case in point. London’s Metro Bank is reinventing the way banking works. Metro colleagues guide customers through important financial decisions using Dynamics CRM Online, Office 365, Power BI and Skype for Business. Customers like Metro are proving that we are at the dawn of a new generation, one with productivity and business process systems that fundamentally changes the nature of work, and more importantly drives superior business outcomes. Looking ahead, we’re poised for new growth given our bold ambition in this space. With Office 2016 and Office 365, we will continue to enrich the features and capabilities to help people create and communicate. As an example, many Office 365 customers will now get rich new voice capabilities with Skype for Business and other new features that have enabled us to expand our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion. The CRM and ERP markets combined are over $60 billion, and represent a massive opportunity for reinvention as they shift to the cloud and mobile experiences. 2) Build the intelligent cloud platform. Microsoft is building a cloud platform that enables the world’s applications to become intelligent using the next-generation infrastructure, data and developer services. We are unique in that we are the only company building out a hyper-scale public cloud while also meeting customer needs for private cloud and hybrid solutions. The Azure cloud platform is now available in 140 countries with over 20 datacenter regions, more than any other public cloud. We are the first multinational company to operate a public cloud in China. Even as organizations transition to the cloud, we continue to see impressive growth in our server business with Windows Server, System Center Server and SQL Server. Our servers are the leading edge of this intelligent cloud, and this is important because there are going to be many legitimate reasons for people wanting digital sovereignty. We believe this is the future of true distributed computing infrastructure, designed to meet the needs and complexities of the real world. Microsoft Enterprise Mobility had a breakout year, and now more than 17,000 customers are using the service. EMS delivers infrastructure for enterprises of all sizes to manage and secure all of their identities, applications, data and devices. In doing so, EMS enables a new way for organizations to work in a world where they are increasingly mobile and using SaaS services. We are helping transform businesses through the use of data. Cortana Analytics Suite provides customers and application developers with a fully managed big data and analytics suite that transforms data into intelligent action. These capabilities are being used by customers across the full spectrum of industries throughout the economy. And we are capitalizing on the advent of the Internet of Things and the associated changes in business models that require increasingly advanced cloud data and analytics capabilities. We made tremendous progress in our developer engagement this past year by delivering new innovative services to developers across all device platforms and also opening our technology to create more participation from open source communities. Visual Studio Online now provides a leading set of services for modern development. I am excited about the growth opportunities ahead. We’ve broadened our addressable market by building and acquiring technologies in key growth categories like security, data and analytics, while also delivering greater integration and support for Linux and open source technologies such as Docker containers and Hadoop. Security is a key priority for our enterprise customers and represents a $30 billion market opportunity. Likewise, business intelligence and analytics is another rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are expanding our datacenter presence to India and Canada, and will evaluate future expansion opportunities as well. We also have major new releases planned across Windows Server and SQL Server in the coming year that will provide continued opportunity for growth and include innovations developed in our public cloud to empower customers’ IT and developer teams to achieve more. 3) Create more personal computing. Our ambition is to make your Windows experience, whether at home or at work, more natural, more mobile, and more trusted. Whether using our devices for productivity, gaming, browsing or anything else, we want to move customers from needing, to choosing, to loving Windows. With the launch of Windows 10, we’re just at the start of a new era of computing that’s more personal, focused on the mobility of human experiences across devices. Innovations such as Continuum on Lumia phones running Windows 10, for example, enable you to simply take your phone and attach it to a screen and keyboard providing robust productivity experiences so your phone can function as a laptop. Windows 10 is more personal and more productive with Cortana, Office and universal apps. Windows 10 is delivering truly breakthrough new experiences, like inking on our new browser, Microsoft Edge, and gaming across Xbox and PCs. It also opens up entirely new device categories such as HoloLens. Security and trust are essential. Windows 10 is safe, secure and always upto date. And it provides a single device management platform across all devices, from phones, to laptops, to Internet of Things devices. We’re excited and appreciative to see the enthusiastic response to Windows 10 with more than 110 million devices already active with the latest Windows. Going forward, I believe we will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. This holiday, we will see the widest range ever of Windows devices, including hundreds of new hardware designs from our partners. With Surface, our vision that customers would want a tablet that can replace a laptop has added to the Windows ecosystem and created new opportunities for our partners to innovate. We’ll also grow through monetization opportunities across the commercial and consumer spaces. In the enterprise, customers will continue to value our unparalleled management, security and servicing capabilities. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities with Store, search and gaming. New growth. With all of this new innovation hitting the market, we are on track to reach two important goals for fiscal year 2018: a commercial cloud revenue annual run rate of $20 billion and 1 billion Windows 10 active devices per month. Our approach to growth is simple — we’ll make products and services that are differentiated in markets that are large and growing and pioneer new categories. We’ll continue the transition from a transactional relationship with customers to one that recognizes the more consistent, lifetime value of a customer. Each of our three ambitions positions Microsoft to increase the lifetime value of our customers and win new customers in every part of the world. We work hard to earn the trust you’ve shown with your investment. Our past success and ongoing execution make it possible for us to deliver the financial performance, strength of balance sheet and return of capital today. It’s our passion for innovation and ambition in rapidly growing markets is what has the potential to deliver new value long into the future. Culture. Simply stated, I want Microsoft to be the greatest place to work for smart people who are hungry to make a difference. It’s been said that culture is the widening of the mind and of the spirit. We spend far too much of our lives at work not to find deep meaning in what we do. The broad aperture of our mission and appetite for growth invites diversity in all delineations so all employees can uniquely contribute and bring their best every day. When people are doing what they love and pursuing a mission they believe in with a growth mindset, I know both great innovation and growth will happen. When I first started in my new role last year I told employees it was time for us to rediscover our soul — what makes us unique. In “The Soul of a New Machine,” author Tracy Kidder shows us that technology is nothing more than the collective soul of those who built it. The technology is fascinating, but even more fascinating is the profound obsession of its designers. In the year ahead we will continue to ask ourselves what are the challenges mankind faces, how can technology help, and what is the contribution of Microsoft? We can clearly see that there’s a transformation underway in our business and renewed spirit in our hallways. We are just starting to get a glimpse of how Microsoft technology empowers customers to succeed and make their own difference in the world. We are eager to see what we can do in the year ahead to drive greater growth and greater impact in our world."
2016,MICROSOFT,"I’m proud of the progress we’ve made as a company this past year and excited about the opportunity for even more progress in the year ahead. We’ve advanced our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We’ve continued to cultivate a Microsoft culture in which people connect their individual energies and passions for technology to this mission. We’re leading profound digital transformation both for people and institutions. We’ve achieved strong financial results. And we’re building a sturdy foundation for an even brighter future. We generated $85.3 billion in revenue, $52.5 billion in gross margin, and $20.2 billion in operating income this past fiscal year. Adjusting for Windows 10 revenue deferrals and impairment, integration and restructuring expenses, revenue was $92.0 billion with $27.9 billion in operating income. Even as we invested in innovation and expanded geographically, we maintained our commitment to shareholder return and increased our total cash return to $26.1 billion, up 12 percent from last fiscal year. These results reflect exciting new product innovations as well as increases in customer usage and engagement across our businesses: Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $12.1 billion, up more than 50 percent year-over-year. More than 70 million people use Office 365 commercial every single month. Revenue from our cloud platform, Azure, grew triple digits, with usage of key computing and database workloads more than doubling year-over-year. Windows 10 is now active on more than 400 million devices around the world and over 197 billion hours of usage. This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release. Bing has leveraged this incredible usage to become profitable with search advertising revenue up 17 percent, excluding traffic acquisition costs. Xbox Live monthly active users grew 33 percent year-over-year to 49 million. Satya Nadella Over the past year, Microsoft has built momentum in each of its reportable segments, which is detailed below, but it’s the larger opportunity – how technology can inspire and ignite change and renewal – that I want to emphasize in this year’s letter. A transformational opportunity Microsoft is uniquely positioned in this era of massive business and societal transformation. We're the company that cares most deeply about computing technologies for both people and the organizations they build. Our entire purpose is to make things that help our customers make things -- and make things happen. We build the platforms upon which others build digital platforms. After all, each of us, as individuals, is trying to build something that outlasts ourselves, whether that’s a small business, a school, a clinic, or an enterprise. Over the years Microsoft has experienced great success, and today we are just at the beginning of an incredible new wave of opportunity. The next generation of ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence is going to transform every life, every industry, and every country. What this means for organizations is that Microsoft is their partner in digital transformation – engaging customers, empowering employees, optimizing operations, and transforming products. What it means for people is that Microsoft helps them get more out of every moment – creating, collaborating, learning, gaming, being mobile, and staying secure. Let’s look at how we’re doing this within each segment. Productivity and Business Processes Productivity is in our DNA, and so everything we do supports our customers’ digital work and life. Nowhere is digital transformation more evident than how we live and work today. We work on the go. We are on more teams, both inside and outside the company. We don’t have time for the information we need personally and professionally to live in different silos. We’re not simply building individual tools, but rather designing an intelligent fabric based on four principles – collaboration, mobility, intelligence, and trust. People still do important work as individuals, but collaboration is the new norm, so we build our tools to empower teams. We aspire to help everyone be productive no matter where they are, regardless of the device they use. Your data, apps, and settings – all of your content – roam with you across your computing experiences. Intelligence is an amazing force multiplier. To be successful amid the explosion of data, people need analytics, services, and agents that use intelligence to help them manage their scarcest resource – time. Finally, trust is the foundation upon which everything we do is built. That’s why we are investing deeply in security and compliance that set the standard for enterprise-grade productivity. The two pillars of this ambition are Office 365 and Dynamics 365. Office 365 is changing the nature of work for individuals and teams. Customers love the power of Office on Windows and Mac as well as their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, Office is on more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices, up more than four times over last year. Industry analyst surveys report that in cloud email, Microsoft is the clear choice. And we continue to see great momentum as innovative companies like GE, Facebook, Hershey, and Discovery Communications adopt Office 365. We recently launched Dynamics 365 to empower business users with built-in insights and intelligence, accessed from within the business applications they’re working on – cloud-based apps like field service, sales, finance, and operations. It is deeply integrated with Office 365 to bring together all of the capabilities people need to get their jobs done. Business process tools in the past were hostage to silos of information and monolithic suites of applications. We’re removing those impedances by bringing together communications and collaboration capabilities so they work seamlessly for every role. Overall, Dynamics 365 builds on a strong base of nearly 10 million monthly paid seats, up more than 20 percent year-over-year. And in this past year, we saw Dynamics CRM Online seat additions more than double year-over-year, driving overall Dynamics revenue growth. This year Microsoft and LinkedIn announced our agreement to join forces to connect the world’s professional cloud and the world’s professional network – creating new experiences and new value for users. Together we will have a transformative effect through our shared ambition to reinvent ways for professionals to be more productive. With more than 1.2 billion Office users and 433 million LinkedIn members, our combined data graphs will forever change how Sales, HR, and other professionals get work done. Meetings will get better when Cortana can draw on your professional network to connect the dots so you stay one step ahead. Your online newsfeed will become more intelligent as the professional cloud and network tailor information to what’s going on at work, upcoming meetings, and projects underway. This acquisition will grow our total addressable market by creating a vibrant network that brings together a professional’s information in LinkedIn’s public network with the information created in Office 365 and Dynamics 365. Looking ahead, our vision is to teach human language to all of the computing experiences that surround us. We imagine a world in which a deeply personal agent understands you, your organization, and your world, helping you get more out of every moment. Skype and Outlook with their hundreds of millions of users already are conversational canvases that will increasingly become rich platforms for getting every task done with new applications in the form of bots. Intelligent Cloud Our ambition to build the intelligent cloud is closely linked with the previous ambition. In fact, together with cloud-based applications like Office 365 and Dynamics 365, we are on track to achieve $20 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate in fiscal year 2018. Every organization needs new cloud-based infrastructure and applications that can convert vast amounts of data into predictive and analytical power through the use of advanced machine learning, analytics, and cognitive services. The combination of Azure’s infrastructure and data services makes it possible for businesses to build digital transformation applications that better engage customers, optimize operations, and transform products and business models. From an infrastructure perspective, we’ve continued to deliver on the promise of a global, hyperscale cloud platform with 30 unique Azure regions around the world. For perspective, we cover more countries and regions than any other cloud provider, from North America, to Asia, to Europe, to Latin America. We’re continuing to invest billions of dollars each year to build out more and more infrastructure. What this means for our customers is that they can scale their solutions without worrying about their cloud platform’s capacity or the complex demands of transparency, reliability, security, privacy, and compliance. In essence, we’re meeting their real-world needs both for today and tomorrow. The Microsoft Cloud is open and offers choice. We broadly support a wide range of platforms and developer tools on Azure. Our acquisition of Xamarin, and our work with Red Hat, Docker, Mesosphere, and others reflect our commitment to working cross-platform. Nearly a third of customer virtual machines on Azure run Linux. We are building our server products to become the edge of our cloud, supporting true hybrid computing. SQL Server 2016, Windows Server 2016, and System Center 2016 as well as Azure Stack enable customers to build a cloud platform that spans their own data centers and the public cloud. Revenue within the Intelligent Cloud segment alone increased $1.3 billion, or 6 percent, driven in part by impressive gains in our Azure business. Azure revenue and usage grew by more than 100 percent in the final quarter of the year. More than 70 percent of the Fortune 500 have at least two different Microsoft Cloud offerings. And more than 80 percent of the world’s largest banks are Azure customers. We clearly are now one of the two enterprise cloud leaders. It’s not just infrastructure driving this growth, but also the intelligence we infuse into applications. Customers such as Boeing, Jabil Circuit, and Land O’Lakes are using Microsoft’s industry-leading data management, machine learning, analytics, and cognitive services to infuse intelligence into their applications. The integration of cloud-based cognitive services like Cortana is just the tip of the spear, and will fuel our vision for conversation as a platform. We have more than 20 cognitive services APIs today, including for vision, speech, text, recommendations, and face and emotion detection. Developers use these APIs within their applications to augment users’ experiences by enabling solutions to see, hear, speak, and interpret the world around them. Our intelligent cloud is democratizing these capabilities for startups, small businesses, and enterprises alike. More Personal Computing Just as we are transforming business and society through cloud computing, we’re also revolutionizing the workplace to help organizations be more productive, and people do more. This was the year of reinventing Windows and delivering a renewed vision of one of the world’s most successful operating systems. We launched Windows 10 with a new concept – to enable Windows as a service, continuously delivering differentiated value across our ecosystem to better serve the needs of our customers. We engineered Windows 10 to enable innovative and more natural ways to interact and engage with devices – ask a question with your voice, draw with the flick of a pen, and secure your most important things with a smile or a touch. These experiences place users at the center so they can move seamlessly across all devices – from the PC, Xbox, phones, and Surface Hub, to mixed reality with Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Holographic. With an installed base of more than 1 billion Windows devices – more than 400 million of which are already on Windows 10 and its 197 billion hours of usage – we have an opportunity to offer new experiences and deepen our engagement with Windows users. We see opportunities to innovate and grow in areas such as productivity and gaming, bringing these experiences to every device. And we continue to inspire new, innovative device categories like the two-in-one Surface, the pioneering HoloLens, and over 1,500 new Windows devices designed with our OEM partners. Led by state-of-the-art security, Windows 10 is starting to drive digital transformation for customers in the enterprise. The U.S. Department of Defense and Accenture are just a few of the customers deploying Windows 10 to millions of employees to help protect them with industry-leading security features like Credential Guard, Device Guard, Windows Hello, and new cloud-based security services like Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. Our belief in building world-class enterprise security in Windows has contributed to nearly every one of our enterprise customers piloting Windows 10 this past fiscal year. Windows is also built to support everyday experiences for everyone. Cortana – the first truly personal digital assistant -- came to life in Windows 10. Embedded within Windows 10, Cortana gets to know each user, helping to get things done, to organize schedules, respond to questions – all through natural user interaction. And by learning more about the user over time, Cortana becomes increasingly useful every day. The Windows 10 Cortana search box has over 126 million monthly active users, and has been asked 12 billion questions to date. In turn, this intensity and frequency of usage helped drive Bing’s U.S. PC query share to nearly 22 percent in the final quarter of our past fiscal year. Gaming is another area where Windows 10 will open new user experiences and scenarios. Gaming has been among the leading drivers of engagement on Windows 10, with more than 17.5 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs in its first year. Xbox Live is connecting fans across Windows 10, iOS, and Android. Microsoft has an incredibly engaged gaming audience on Xbox Live with 49 million monthly users and growing – up 33 percent year-over-year. This growth is driven in part by strong franchises like Minecraft, which has sold more than 106 million copies to date. In fact, Xbox Live players of Minecraft increased 62 percent in the last year. Our gaming roadmap over the next 18 months is anchored by two significant console releases – Xbox One S and Project Scorpio – and investments in growth areas such as virtual reality, video, and eSports. We continue to grow the Windows ecosystem by creating new computing categories. Surface, Surface Hub, and Microsoft HoloLens have pushed the boundaries of how personal the computing experience can be, with Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 released in the last year. Forward-looking customers like Rolls Royce, the PGA Tour, Japan Airlines, and Volvo already are embracing Microsoft HoloLens and the Windows Holographic platform, transforming the way they work by breaking down the barriers between virtual and physical reality. We are excited about these future growth areas but are also committed to ensuring that we are investing thoughtfully across our portfolio. Over the past fiscal year, we increased investment in key capabilities within Windows 10 and in new growth markets, while at the same time scaling back our investment commensurate with the opportunity in areas like phone. Across each of these ambitions, Microsoft made significant progress this past year. And we’re investing in a future that is even more exciting. Investing in the Future Earlier in this letter I described the transformational opportunities that lie ahead, particularly in the realm of digital intelligence. We’re growing today’s core businesses and technologies, incubating for the future and investing in long-term computing breakthroughs. Within our research labs we’re hard at work on advanced machine learning – artificial intelligence – that will produce forewarnings that can put an end to distracted driving and one day identify a crisis like Zika before it happens. Quantum computing, theorized for decades by some of the world’s greatest minds as a way to harness the very building blocks of matter and energy for unimaginable computing capabilities and intelligence, is emerging today as a feasible technology. Its realization will bring new power to cure disease and address global challenges like climate change. Our people and partners right now are solving the hard problems of experimental and theoretical physics, mathematics, and computer science that will accelerate quantum computing’s becoming a reality. And that brings us right back to our mission – to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Computing and societal impact Last year I concluded this letter committing that we would continue to ask ourselves what are the challenges humankind faces, how can technology help, and what is the contribution of Microsoft? To me, these questions are essential to the rediscovery of the soul of Microsoft, and more broadly, the purpose of global companies in society. This past year we’ve witnessed movements that understandably question globalization and its impact on economic equality. With worldwide per capita GDP and productivity growth at roughly 1 percent, how do we return to vigorous growth that benefits everyone? That’s part of what we’re working to address both through our core business and through our broader work societally, including this past year with the founding of Microsoft Philanthropies. When I meet with leaders in every part of the world, I hear their desire to work with Microsoft to create world class, cloud-enabled platforms, and applications that advance health, education, and economic growth, locally in their countries and communities. That is what inspires me most. And it’s why we are working with public and private sector partners to promote a public cloud for public good – expanding affordable internet connectivity, building next generation skills, and fostering policies that promote trustworthy computing in the cloud. This past year we announced that Microsoft Philanthropies will donate $1 billion in public cloud computing for nonprofits around the world. Throughout our discussions with LinkedIn this year, I was struck in my conversations with founder Reid Hoffman and CEO Jeff Weiner that we share a commitment to more directly and more evenly spread opportunity for everyone. In fact, LinkedIn’s vision has been to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce—all 3 billion of them—by building the world’s first economic graph, a digital representation of the global economy and opportunity. The goal is to make labor markets work better for everyone by making them more efficient and open. Together we aspire to help everyone navigate an increasingly challenging global economy more effectively. In conclusion, the test of any brand is its ability to have measurable impact and to remain relevant over time. Microsoft has done this in times of transition by innovating boldly. When I walk the hallways of Microsoft and talk with our talented people, the sense of purpose and urgency in realizing our mission through world class innovation is unmistakable."
2017,MICROSOFT,"We continue to be guided by our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. The breadth and depth of our mission unlocks unprecedented opportunity as technology transforms every industry and has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone. We strive to create local opportunity, growth and impact in every community and country around the world. Our platforms and tools enable creativity in all of us, and help drive small-business productivity, large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers’ success. Now let me share more about what we delivered in fiscal 2017 for our shareholders, our customers and partners, and for the communities in which we operate throughout the world. PROGRESS AND OUR RESULTS We delivered $90.0 billion in revenue and $22.3 billion in operating income this past fiscal year. Adjusting for Windows 10 revenue deferrals and restructuring expenses, revenue was $96.7 billion with $29.3 billion in operating income. We continued to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to shareholder return, which included total cash return of $22.3 billion this year. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate ended the year exceeding $18.9 billion, up more than 56 percent year-over-year. Our cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over two years ago of $20 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate in fiscal 2018. The strength of our results across our reporting segments reflects our accelerating innovation as well as increased customer usage and engagement across our businesses. More than 100 million people use Office 365 commercial. More than 27 million consumers use Office 365 Home & Personal across devices. More than 53 million members are active on Xbox Live. More than 500 million LinkedIn members use the LinkedIn network. Windows 10 is active on more than 500 million devices around the world. Dynamics 365 customers grew more than 40 percent year-over-year. Azure compute usage more than doubled year-over-year. We prioritized our investments to capture our expanding market opportunities. We are investing for the future with product innovation complemented by new acquisitions and partnerships. We have completed our acquisition of LinkedIn to connect the world’s largest professional network with the world’s leading professional cloud. We are investing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity with our datacenter expansion, bringing Azure to 42 regions globally — more than any other cloud provider — and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. We broadened our offerings to reach new audiences, such as bringing Office 365 to firstline workers from retail and hospitality to manufacturing. We took collaboration to a new level with Microsoft Teams, which brings people, conversations and content together in a digital hub. We are in the forefront of innovating in mixed reality and how this new medium can radically change gaming, firstline and knowledge work through immersive experiences. We are innovating in gaming with new services such as Mixer and Xbox Game Pass. We introduced hundreds of new Azure services, including new cognitive services APIs for vision, speech, text, translation, emotion and more. We have galvanized the company’s efforts around AI both to power each of our product categories with breakthrough capabilities and make the same capabilities available to our customers through Azure. We inspired new ways for students and teachers to create and learn with Windows 10 S. And we continued to create new device categories with Windows 10 and Surface, including the new Surface Studio and Laptop. And we’re continually transforming to better serve customers, evolving our sales and marketing approach to galvanize around five core customer solution areas. Across every industry in every corner of the world, our customers are using Microsoft technologies to radically transform everything from agriculture to manufacturing, and we are only at the beginning. Here are some examples. BOEING Boeing is using Microsoft HoloLens for 3-D visualization to transform employee training, and it is using Cortana Intelligence, Azure and Azure IoT to harness a wealth of aircraft data. This “digital twin” aircraft increases crew and maintenance efficiency, improves customer experience, and creates a new business model and services that Boeing can offer its airline customers. THYSSENKRUPP thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens to transform the way it measures, visualizes and installs its products, streamlining the initial surveying process of a stair lift installation. Using spatial mapping, 3-D visualization and the natural inputs offered by mixed reality, the company has digitized its sales and manufacturing processes to reduce delivery times as much as 4x, transforming its customer experience and growing its business opportunity. TETRA PAK Tetra Pak, the world’s largest food packaging company and inventor of the 20th century’s most important innovation in that industry, aseptic packaging technology, employs Azure to enable its cloud-connected machines to predict exactly when equipment needs maintenance. Service engineers use HoloLens to access experts who remotely guide them through a repair, reducing time and cost. With the cloud and mixed reality, Tetra Pak is delivering new and existing value in a much more efficient way — in the most remote locations, on the most mobile devices. LAND O’ LAKES Land O’ Lakes is working to feed the world sustainably by embracing the Microsoft Cloud, predictive data analytics and mobile technologies in tandem with family farmers. Using Azure, Office 365 and Surface, farmers in different parts of the world can access agronomic research, weather information and satellite data to make the right planting decisions and react to real-time changes in the field, every day. SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC Responsible and sustainable management of fresh water is one of the world’s biggest challenges. With 70 percent of fresh water reserves being used for agricultural purposes, every drop counts. Schneider Electric has built a smart farming platform using Azure IoT to enable farmers to more efficiently manage water use. Advanced analytics, live local data from sensors on the farm and access to pricing information from the local water utility allow farmers to maximize crop and livestock yields and lower energy consumption by pumping water at optimal times. CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY AND CLEVELAND CLINIC Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic are using mixed reality to transform medical education. Using HoloLens, they built an entirely new and immersive way to teach and learn human anatomy. Doctors who have looked at data sets like this for years say they have never fully understood the 3-D structure until seeing it as a hologram with HoloLens, giving them the ability to see a brain tumor in mixed reality and predict the impact of the tumor with 3-D modeling, or seeing the aortic valve in true relation to the critical structures around it. LOOKING FORWARD: OUR EXPANSIVE OPPORTUNITY A new technology paradigm As you can begin to see in the examples above, a new technology paradigm is emerging, one with an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. Microsoft will lead this new era. There are three characteristics that define this shift. The first is that the experience layer is becoming multidevice and multisense, where a person’s experience with technology will span a multitude of devices and become increasingly more natural and multisensory with voice, ink, gestures and gaze interactions. Second, artificial intelligence (AI) will be pervasive across devices, apps and infrastructure to drive insights and act on your behalf. Third, computing will be more distributed than ever before with compute power at the edge, whether it’s the connected car, the connected factory floor or any connected device. As developers write new applications for this paradigm, they need new mechanisms to manage the complexity of distributed, event-driven computing. With this new paradigm comes new opportunity. Every customer is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth and a strategic partner that can help them build their own digital capability. Customers are looking to change how they use digital technology and to reimagine how they empower their employees, engage customers, optimize their operations, and change the very core of their products and services. They are building their own digital systems of intelligence to drive growth. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity with the combination of our technology, partner ecosystem and culture of growth mindset. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we will focus on bringing our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that deliver new value for our customers. Going forward, we will focus our innovation and investments in areas where we see the greatest opportunity for growth. The modern workplace The workplace itself is transforming — from changing employee expectations, a widening skills gap, more diverse and globally distributed teams, to an increasingly complex threat environment. The productivity experiences and tools we deliver will unlock the creator in all of us and enable seamless teamwork not just in the workplace, but also at school and at home across all the devices people use — from the phone to the laptop to mixed-reality headsets to the whiteboard. Microsoft 365 — which brings together Windows 10, Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility & Security — will be a key driver of value for our business customers of all sizes and for our business growth. The Microsoft Graph, which provides the underlying data model of the user’s experience, and the LinkedIn network, will make it possible for every professional in any business or functional role to be much more productive in getting things done. Business applications Every process inside a business is being digitized. This rapid shift means customers are looking to move away from monolithic suites that perpetuate disconnected data siloes and expensive custom extensibility frameworks. Our approach with Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn is to build modular business applications that are part of a connected data graph, enabling AI and extensibility that span a customer’s business process needs. We will enable organizations of all sizes to digitize business-critical functions across relationship sales, talent and people processes, operations, customer service, field service, and more. Applications and infrastructure Cloud computing is foundational to enabling digital transformation for any organization. Beyond being a trusted, global, hyper-scale cloud, what makes Azure unique is our hybrid consistency, developer productivity and SaaS application integration. Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans identity, data, compute, management and security, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprise-focused SaaS ISVs. Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that enables developers to build and deploy applications the same way whether they run on the intelligent cloud or the intelligent edge. With Visual Studio and Azure Services, we provide the toolchain and application platform for modern DevOps that helps organizations with their agility and productivity — and enable them to use the best of the Windows ecosystem and the best of the Linux ecosystem together. Azure enables SaaS ISV developers to reach 100 million plus enterprise users through the integration of Azure Active Directory and Office 365, and by embedding Power BI, Power Apps and Flow as part of their applications, enables customers to have consistent identity, developer extensibility and security across their application portfolio spanning their own custom applications and SaaS applications. Data and AI The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to reason over its data using AI to drive competitive advantage. Microsoft Research continues to make significant advances in AI technologies, infusing them into product experiences like Bing, Cortana, LinkedIn Newsfeed, Skype Translator, Editor and PowerPoint Designer in Office, Relationship Health in Dynamics, HoloLens, and many more. We are uniquely positioned to take this AI capability and democratize it, so that every developer can be an AI developer, and every company can become an AI company. It all starts with having support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse and Data Lake, combined with SQL Server. Azure is the cloud with the richest set of ML tools, bot framework and cognitive services, enabling developers to add AI capabilities into their applications. With state-of-the-art GPU and FPGA support, our Azure infrastructure is best in class for AI workloads. I am excited about our road map here and what’s to come. Gaming The $100 billion plus gaming industry is experiencing massive growth and transformation, and we have an expansive opportunity as we think about gaming end-to-end — from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We will build on our strong foundation of connected gaming assets across PC, console, mobile and work to grow and engage the 53 million strong Xbox Live member network more deeply and frequently — from great game experiences to streaming to social to mixed reality. We will be the company for gamers to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. I’m excited about our opportunity to accelerate our growth opportunity, innovate boldly and earn new fans. While these solution areas capture our near-term opportunity, we’re also investing in cutting-edge research to lead well into the future. Artificial intelligence, mixed reality and quantum computing will come together and shape the future of our industry and others for generations to come. We’re deeply committed to leading in these areas and bringing them together in ways that enable humanity to solve our most pressing issues, from climate change to curing cancer to creating economic opportunity for all. We will do so by adhering to the highest ethical principles and standing for our timeless values. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WORLD Our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet extends to our corporate social responsibility efforts. We strive to use our technology, grants, employees and voice to improve people’s lives by enabling access to the benefits and opportunities that technology offers. This past year we increased our investments across a range of strategic initiatives. Microsoft Philanthropies donated more than $1.2 billion in software and services in fiscal 2017, helping nonprofits around the world get the technology and skills they need for today’s digital economy. Since 2016 we have donated more than $1 billion in cloud services to more than 90,000 nonprofits and university researchers — achieving our $1 billion milestone a year early — and announced a new plan to more than triple the number of nonprofits we’ll reach to 300,000 over the next three years. Our employees raised a record-breaking $142 million through our employee giving program in 2016. I am proud and humbled by their commitment to not only make a difference with our customers and partners, but in their local communities and the broader world. We’re ensuring that our products and services are accessible to meet the needs of all our customers, including the more than 1 billion people around the world with disabilities. Examples include our new Eye Control feature in Windows 10 for people with ALS, and Seeing AI, a free app on iOS for blind and low vision users that narrates the world around you. We’re partnering with telecommunications companies through our Rural Airband Initiative to bring broadband connectivity to 2 million people in rural America by 2022, helping to close the rural broadband gap for the more than 20 million Americans living in rural communities who lack access to the economic, educational and health opportunities the internet provides. We’re advancing our sustainability efforts, completing our largest wind energy purchase to date and aiming to address some of the world’s toughest environment challenges through our new AI for Earth initiative. Finally, as part of our broader responsibility to engage thoughtfully in the public dialogue on the important challenges facing our world, we published “A Cloud for Global Good” to help companies and governments ensure technology is trusted, responsible and inclusive. When I reflect on the past year, I’m proud of our progress — both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to digitally transform. As a multinational corporation, we have both a substantial opportunity and a high responsibility to ensure that technology’s benefits reach people more broadly across our global society and economy. Everywhere we operate, we focus on contributing to local communities in positive ways — helping to spark growth, competitiveness and economic opportunity for all. To serve the needs of our customers well into the future, we must continually transform while remaining steadfast to our timeless values. Microsoft has both the capability and the culture to help customers digitally transform today, while creating new technologies that are among the most innovative and impactful humankind has ever experienced with mixed reality, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. We will continue to invest in the highest growth opportunities, innovate boldly, and empower people and organizations by creating the platforms and tools that enable others to grow and thrive, now and well into the future."
2018,MICROSOFT,"As I reflect on our progress this past year, I first want to say thank you for your commitment and investment in Microsoft. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together as we innovate and help customers navigate their digital transformation, and I am even more optimistic about the opportunity ahead. We are living at a crucial time in history where the impact of technology on every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy is more acute than ever before. It is incumbent upon leaders of our industry to ensure that the technology we build always creates opportunity. Too often, we celebrate technology disruption for the sake of disruption without reflecting on its unintended consequences. What the world needs is technology that benefits people and society more broadly and is trusted. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our business model is dependent on our customers’ and partners’ success. We are grounded in creating local economic opportunity in every community, helping to unlock the power of technology to address our customers’ most pressing challenges. Our platforms and tools enable creativity in all of us. They help drive small-business productivity, large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers’ success. Our culture enables us to pursue our mission with a growth mindset. It’s a continuous practice of learning, renewal and having the courage to confront our own fixed mindsets. Collectively, we are moving from a group of people who know it all to a group of people who want to learn it all. To achieve our mission, we must reflect the diverse perspectives and experiences of our customers around the world. We must have a deep sense of their unmet and unarticulated needs. Each day we are pushing ourselves to be more customer obsessed, to be more diverse and inclusive, and to operate as One Microsoft — ultimately to make a bigger difference in the world. OPPORTUNITY AND IMPACT One of the greatest privileges I have as CEO of Microsoft is seeing firsthand the incredible impact our technologies have on people and organizations around the world. Our ecosystem touches the lives of billions of people every single day, creating new opportunity for our customers and partners and positively impacting local communities. In Kenya, our partner M-KOPA Solar has connected hundreds of thousands of homes across sub-Saharan Africa to solar power for the first time using the Microsoft Cloud, innovating with a pay-as-you-go model that helps households living on less than $2 a day establish a credit history. In Arizona, we are applying Dynamics 365 to improve outcomes among one of the state’s most vulnerable populations — the more than 15,000 children in foster care. In Poland, MedApp is using HoloLens to help cardiologists visualize a patient's heart as it beats — in real time — reducing the amount of time they then need to perform open-heart surgery. In Kona, Hawaii, Jack’s Diving Locker is using Microsoft 365 to connect its 50 employees across land and sea so that they can focus on what they do best — protect pristine coral reefs and take people diving. In Washington state, Karrick Johnson, an 8-year-old with dyslexia, avoided reading in class until he started using our Learning Tools. And in Cambodia, underserved children in rural communities are learning to code with Minecraft, opening doors to futures that would have previously been unimaginable. Across the globe, enterprise customers in every industry — from iconic brands like Coca-Cola Company and Chevron Corporation to ZF Group, a car parts manufacturer in Germany — are using our technology to build their own digital capability so they can thrive in a world where every company is a software company. Walmart — the world’s largest company by revenue, and its biggest private employer — chose Azure and Microsoft 365 to fuel its digital transformation, transforming the shopping experience for customers and empowering their more than 2 million associates to do their best work. In sum, our platforms create broad surplus everywhere, from the farmer who is able to apply precision agriculture to conserve resources and increase yields, to the hospital that is able to lower the cost of healthcare and improve patient outcomes, to the largest companies of the world reaching new customers in new markets. RESULTS AND PROGRESS The breadth and depth of our mission and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation enable us to have this broad impact — and it is fueling our results. In fiscal 2018, we delivered $110.4 billion in revenue and $35.1 billion in operating income and returned $21.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commercial cloud business delivered more than $23 billion in revenue, exceeding the ambitious goal we had set to achieve $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue by the end of fiscal 2018, nine months ahead of schedule. In addition, we expanded our commercial cloud gross margin to 57 percent, up 7 points year-over-year. These are strong results — and yet the opportunity ahead in a world powered by an intelligent cloud and edge is unprecedented. Imagine a future where all of your apps and experiences revolve around you and transcend any single device; where data in any form is analyzed in real time so that computers can anticipate and even act on your behalf and augment what you would otherwise be able to accomplish on your own. And where computing is more distributed and embedded in the world, from intelligent digital assistants at work, on the go and in your home that you can communicate with in a myriad of ways — voice, eyes or gestures — to oil rigs that adjust production in real time as demand fluctuates in global markets. Across each of our customer solution areas, we are broadening our offerings and accelerating our innovation to capture the opportunities this new era will create for our customers and better meet their unarticulated needs. Modern Workplace We expanded our Microsoft 365 offerings to reach new audiences and empower more employees for the modern workplace, protecting data from increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and delivering secure productivity and collaboration tools. Already a multi-billion-dollar business, Microsoft 365 gives customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and under-penetrated markets — from Fortune 500 enterprises to small businesses to more than 2 billion firstline workers. More than 135 million people use Office 365 commercial every month, and Outlook Mobile is helping people be productive and stay secure on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices worldwide — with AI-infused experiences they use every day. Microsoft Teams has rapidly become the hub for teamwork and is being used by more than 300,000 organizations of all sizes, including 87 of the Fortune 100. Windows 10 is now active on nearly 700 million devices around the world. And we continue to create new device categories with always-on, always-connected Windows 10 PCs and an expanded family of Surface devices including the new Surface Go — setting the bar for the industry. Business Applications Every process inside a business is being digitized, and we are winning customers with our differentiated approach, enabling organizations of all sizes to digitize critical business functions — from sales to marketing to HR. Dynamics 365 is the alternative to monolithic, siloed suites of business applications with modular, extensible and AI-driven apps that are part of a connected data graph and unlock insights across every part of the organization. Net seats grew 52 percent year-over-year, and our investments in Power BI have made Microsoft the leader in business analytics in the cloud. Our recently announced Open Data Initiative with Adobe and SAP will enable our customers to take control of their data and build new experiences that truly put people at the center. And we are innovating with HoloLens and mixed reality to create immersive experiences that digitize physical spaces and interactions to transform training, collaboration and design for firstline workers, who account for 80 percent of the world’s workforce. LinkedIn is the essential platform to connect the world’s professionals and create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. LinkedIn now has more than 575 million members, and we are continuously innovating to give them new ways to connect and engage with one another — from increasing the relevancy of the LinkedIn Feed to a better mobile experience, to introducing new video and messaging capability. And we are transforming how companies manage talent, training, and sales and marketing with new solutions powered by the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution in an increasingly competitive talent marketplace, and deep integration of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 redefines social selling, enabling sales professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. We will continue to innovate across the LinkedIn platform to add new value for members and customers. Applications and Infrastructure To thrive in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, customers need a consistent computing stack from the cloud to the edge. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform, and security and management — and this architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. Azure revenue grew 91 percent year-over-year. And we are investing aggressively to build Azure as the world’s computer. We expanded our global datacenter footprint to 54 regions — more than any other cloud provider — and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry to meet evolving regulatory needs, creating broader economic benefit and opportunity in local markets on six continents. With Project Natick, we even innovated beyond land, experimenting with a full-scale subsea, zero emissions datacenter with the promise of setting new standards for datacenter provisioning, latency and sustainability. We added nearly 500 new Azure capabilities in the past year alone, focused on both existing workloads and new workloads such as IoT and Edge AI. IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing, retail, and oil and gas — fueling cloud and edge innovation, accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply-chain performance. Azure IoT and Azure Stack — a first-of-its-kind cloud-to-edge solution — enable customers and partners to build IoT solutions that run at the edge, so people from the factory floor to the retail store to the oil rig can manage devices and analyze data in real time. We introduced Azure Sphere, another first-of-its-kind, highly secure edge solution that combines chip design, an IoT operating system and a cloud service to secure the more than 9 billion microcontroller-powered devices entering the market each year — from kitchen appliances to industrial equipment. It’s an incredible example of how we are helping our customers realize the promise of a world of connected devices and things. And, our ambition extends beyond today’s computers to quantum computing to take us beyond the limitations of traditional, transistor-based computers and enable entirely new scenarios. We first unveiled our vision for quantum last year, and we are already seeing customers apply our quantum-inspired algorithms to address some of their most pressing challenges. Data and AI Our customers will increasingly need to build their own AI to extract insights from the ever-increasing amount of data they collect — and we are investing to make Azure the best cloud for their comprehensive data estates. We are democratizing data science and AI with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Machine Learning and data services such as Azure Cosmos DB — the first globally distributed, multi-model database — to help organizations of all sizes convert their data into insights and experiences for competitive advantage. In less than a year, Azure Cosmos DB has already exceeded $100 million in annualized revenue. Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL makes it even easier to bring open source-powered applications to Azure, expanding our opportunity in this space. And we are seeing rapid customer adoption of Azure Databricks for data preparation, advanced analytics and machine learning scenarios. We are leading in the field of AI research, achieving human parity with object recognition, speech recognition, machine reading and — this year — language translation. But that is not enough. We are committed to translating these breakthroughs into toolsets our customers can use. More than 1 million developers have already used our Cognitive Services to quickly and easily create AI applications. Our Azure Bot Service has nearly 300,000 developers, and we are driving new advances in our underlying cloud infrastructure, building the world’s first AI supercomputer in Azure. Microsoft Translator brings AI-powered translation to developers where their data is, whether in the cloud or on the edge. Our pending acquisition of GitHub recognizes the increasingly vital role developers will play in value creation and growth across every industry, and will enable us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos. Gaming We are pursuing an expansive opportunity in gaming — from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed — surpassing $10 billion in revenue this year for the first time. We are investing aggressively in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement with gamers. Xbox Live now has 57 million monthly active users, and we are investing in new services like Mixer — which blurs the line between watching and playing — and Game Pass, our new unlimited subscription service. The addition of five new gaming studios this year bolsters our first-party content development to support our fast-growing gaming services. And our acquisition of PlayFab accelerates our vision to build a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry across mobile, PC and console. I’m excited about our opportunity in the fast-growing $100 billion gaming market and what’s to come. TRUST AND RESPONSIBILITY At a time when digital technology is transforming every industry and every part of our daily life and work, our customers are increasingly looking for a partner whose business interests are fundamentally aligned with their own. At Microsoft, our customers’ interests are core to our success. That is what engenders trust. This commitment extends to instilling trust in technology across everything we do. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, which is why compliance is deeply embedded in all our processes and practices. We extended the data subject rights that are at the heart of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to all our customers around the world, not just those in the European Union, and advocated for the passage of the CLOUD Act in the U.S. Cybersecurity is the central challenge of the digital age, and we are innovating to provide end-to-end security for our customers with security operations at global scale that analyze more than 6.5 trillion security signals each day, enterprise-class technology, and broad cybersecurity partnerships for an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. We led the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, which has been signed by 61 global organizations, and are calling on governments to do more to make the internet safe. We announced the Defending Democracy Program to work with governments around the world to help safeguard voting, and introduced AccountGuard to offer advanced cybersecurity protections to political campaigns in the U.S. And, as we make advancements in AI, we are asking ourselves tough questions — like not only what computers can do, but what should they do. That’s why we are investing in tools for detecting and addressing bias in AI systems and advocating for thoughtful government regulation. We also have a responsibility as a company to empower everyone to fully participate in our society and economy using technology. We are working with governments, the private sector and local nonprofit organizations around the world to make this vision a reality. We donated more than $1.4 billion in software and services in fiscal 2018, via Microsoft Philanthropies, helping nonprofits get access to the technology they need to drive greater impact, and in calendar year 2017 our employees donated a record $158 million (including company match) through our employee giving program to support nonprofits in local communities. We are putting AI tools into the hands of change-makers to address society's most pressing challenges with new programs like AI for Earth, a five-year, $50M commitment to environmental sustainability, and AI for Accessibility to benefit the more than 1 billion people with disabilities around the world. I am inspired by how teams across Microsoft are galvanized around inclusive design and accessibility — and producing tangible results, with new features and offerings for Microsoft 365, Office 365, Windows and Xbox designed to meet the needs of people with disabilities. Finally, we know that the jobs of today will not be the jobs of tomorrow and are investing to provide today’s workforce and future generations with the digital skills they will need to succeed, partnering with nonprofit organizations across 54 countries to provide computer science learning experiences to millions of young people around the world and expanding our TEALS program in high schools across the U.S. I’m proud of our progress, and I’m proud of the more than 100,000 Microsoft employees around the world who are focused on our customers’ success in this new era. We have long recognized that the health, wellbeing and diversity of our employees help Microsoft succeed. That’s why we provide industry-leading benefits for our employees, including comprehensive health and wellness programs for families, paid vacation, paid sick leave and paid time off for new parents. We were one of the first companies to require our U.S. suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time off for their employees. And this year we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with paid parental leave. Over the past year, we have made progress in building a diverse and inclusive culture where everyone can do their best work. Since FY16, we have nearly doubled the number of women corporate vice presidents at Microsoft — both overall and in technical roles. We’ve increased African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino representation by 33 percent. And this past fiscal year more than half of our U.S. interns were women or African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino. We must keep pushing to do more, and representation is only one measure of progress. Creating a diverse and inclusive workplace at Microsoft is everyone’s job. And this year we increased our commitment, ensuring that every leader and employee prioritizes diversity and inclusion as part of our annual performance review process. In closing, we will continue to create local opportunity, growth and impact in every community and country around the world. We will continue to invest in the largest growth opportunities and innovate boldly to serve our customers. We will continue to help our customers build digital capability, so they can grow and thrive — today and long into the future. We will continue to work to instill trust in technology across everything we do, to advocate for customer privacy, drive industry-wide cybersecurity initiatives and champion ethical AI. And we will continue to transform our culture to reflect the diverse customers we serve around the world, while holding fast to our timeless values. Last spring, I visited our AI School in Paris, France, which we started earlier this year to provide immersive training to help close the skills gap. Students from different backgrounds and walks of life, with no prior technical experience, are learning new data science skills. They take an intense seven month class, followed by an apprenticeship at one of our local partners — and are ready for new careers in AI and data science. While there, I met Cassandra Delage, a young entrepreneur with an ambitious dream of reimagining recycling. Her company, Plast’if, has created what might be best described as a “recycling vending machine.” You take plastic, put it in the machine, and it’s converted into a useful object you can take with you. She built it with students at the AI School, creating an ML model that recognizes the plastic, deploying it on an inexpensive computer and then integrating it with a 3-D printer — turning her novel idea into reality. It’s just one example of how technology can help create new opportunity and build a better future for everyone. And it’s just the start — I could not be more optimistic about what’s yet to come. "
